**Title**: I Built a Portfolio That Proves Itself (Universal CV Engine)
**Duration**: ~4 minutes

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

I built a portfolio that generates itself. One knowledge base, nine job-specific variants, zero hallucinations.

Found myself between roles a few months ago. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. Maintaining multiple versions by hand was a nightmare. And AI-generated content? Sounds great until someone asks where those metrics came from.

So I built something different. Let me show you how it works.

## THE PROBLEM (0:30 - 1:15)

Here's the problem with portfolios in 2025.

Every product manager has "drove growth" and "led cross-functional teams" on their resume. Metrics help, but metrics without sources feel hollow.

When you're applying for multiple roles, you need different emphasis. The infrastructure PM pitch isn't the Web3 PM pitch. The developer tools PM pitch is different again. Customizing for each role takes hours. Most people either send generic content or burn out.

AI-generated content seems like the answer—until you realize most of it hallucinates. It sounds plausible, but the numbers might be made up. For a portfolio where your professional reputation is on the line, that's unacceptable.

I wanted something that could target each role while keeping every claim defensible in an interview.

## THE BUILD (1:15 - 2:45)

The Universal CV Engine has four layers.

First, the knowledge base. Every achievement I've ever shipped lives in structured files. Each metric traces to a source document. No hallucination possible—the AI can only surface what's already documented.

Second, the variant engine. Give it a job description, and it matches against my knowledge base, scores relevance, and generates a customized portfolio. Different stats, different case study ordering, same underlying facts.

Third, the quality pipeline. This is where it gets interesting. Every variant runs through an evaluation pass—extracting claims, finding sources, verifying each metric. Then red-teaming—scanning for sycophantic language, unverified stats, confidential leaks. Nothing ships without passing both gates.

Fourth, the skills ecosystem. Nine automation skills that codify the whole workflow. The AI doesn't freelance. It follows documented patterns with human approval at each step.

Here's what it looks like in practice. Same portfolio, different variants. Bloomberg Technical PM. Coinbase Product Manager. Galaxy. Meta. Microsoft. Each one tailored to the role, each one traceable to the same source of truth.

## TOP 3 LEARNINGS (2:45 - 3:30)

Building this crystallized three insights from years of shipping products.

**One: Distribution beats product.** At my previous startup, we built the best product. Competitors with worse products still won. The difference was distribution. One ecosystem partnership delivered more than a hundred marketing campaigns.

**Two: Customer isn't always user.** At Ankr, we chased developers for eight months. Made $130K ARR. Shifted to protocols as customers instead—same product, different buyer. Revenue increased 15x. Sometimes the unit economics problem isn't your product. It's who you're optimizing for.

**Three: Trust is the moat.** In institutional crypto, nobody cares about the best APY. They care about auditability. This portfolio applies the same principle—every claim traces to a source. Every stat survives scrutiny.

## CTA (3:30 - 4:00)

The portfolio is live at edgeoftrust.com. Nine variants, 211 passing tests, 100% claim traceability.

After years building infrastructure at Microsoft, Ankr, and Anchorage Digital, I'm exploring what's next. If you're building in Web3, AI infrastructure, or institutional crypto—link in the description, let's connect.

If you found this useful, subscribe. I'm thinking about open-sourcing the variant generation system. Let me know in the comments if that would be helpful.

The Universal CV Engine:
- One knowledge base with all achievements
- Variant engine for job-specific targeting
- Eval pipeline to verify every claim
- Red team checks before anything ships

Built over 3 months. 9 variants. 211 tests. Zero hallucinations.

Currently exploring product roles in Web3, AI infrastructure, and institutional crypto. DMs open.
