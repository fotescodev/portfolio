Found myself between roles a few months ago. Instead of mass-applying, I built something.

The problem: static resumes don't adapt. You need different emphasis for infrastructure PM vs. developer tools PM vs. Web3 PM. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare. And AI-generated content? Sounds good until someone asks where those metrics came from.

So I built a Universal CV Engine. One knowledge base stores every achievement with traceable sources. The system generates targeted variants for each role while ensuring every claim is defensible. Red team checks catch sycophantic language and unverified metrics before anything ships.

Three months later: 9 job-specific variants, 211 passing tests, every stat traceable to source documentation. The portfolio doesn't just show my work—it demonstrates the rigor I bring to shipping.

After years building infrastructure at Microsoft, Ankr, and Anchorage Digital, I'm exploring what's next. If you're building in Web3, AI infrastructure, or institutional crypto—let's talk.
