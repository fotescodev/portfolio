**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
Built a portfolio that generates itself.

One knowledge base. Nine job-specific variants. Zero hallucinations.

Here's how it works: 🧵

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**
The problem with AI-generated portfolios: they sound good until someone asks where those metrics came from.

Static resumes don't adapt. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare.

I needed something that could target each role while keeping every claim defensible.

**Tweet 3 (Solution)**
The Universal CV Engine:

→ Knowledge base stores every achievement with traceable sources
→ Variant engine generates targeted content per job description
→ Eval pipeline verifies each claim against source docs
→ Red team catches sycophantic language and unverified stats

**Tweet 4 (Innovation)**
The key insight: invert the trust problem.

Most AI content: generate first, hope it's accurate.

This system: verify first, generate under constraint.

The AI can only surface what's already documented. Every stat traces to a source file.

**Tweet 5 (Results)**
Three months of building:

• 9 job-specific variants (Bloomberg, Coinbase, Galaxy, Meta, Microsoft...)
• 195KB bundle (59% reduction via code splitting)
• 211 passing tests
• 8 automated red-team checks per variant
• 100% claim traceability

**Tweet 6 (CTA)**
The portfolio is live: edgeoftrust.com

After years building infrastructure at Microsoft, Ankr, and Anchorage—I'm exploring what's next.

If you're building in Web3, AI infrastructure, or institutional crypto: DMs open.

**Tweet 7 (Optional - Engagement Hook)**
Thinking about open-sourcing the variant generation system.

Would that be useful? Reply or RT if you'd use a trust-first AI portfolio generator.
