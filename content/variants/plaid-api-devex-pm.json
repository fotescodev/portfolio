        "At Dapper Labs, I owned Developer Experience—shipping the Flow CLI and Cadence Playground redesign that reduced time-to-first-deploy by 60%. At Ankr, I built the Advanced API from 0→1 (17 methods across NFT, Token, Query APIs) serving 1M+ daily requests, plus the SDK suite (Ankr.js, Ankr.py, React Hooks) with 1,900+ weekly downloads. At Forte, I productized Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs for AAA gaming studios. I've spent years obsessing over API ergonomics, documentation clarity, and what makes developer onboarding feel effortless.\n",
        "Plaid's mission resonates deeply—I've lived the pain of fragmented financial data integration and understand how critical {{accent}}great developer experience{{/accent}} is for platform adoption. My fintech experience at Anchorage Digital (institutional custody APIs, ETF-grade infrastructure) combined with hands-on API/SDK building makes this role feel like a natural fit. I'm excited about defining the vision for how developers experience Plaid.\n"
