        "I recently completed Product Faculty's AI Product Management certification (instructed by Miqdad Jaffer, product leader at OpenAI) and shipped my first production AI at Dapper Labs—a kapa.ai support bot handling 1,000+ developer questions weekly with 98% accuracy. That deployment taught me how to translate LLM capabilities into measurable user outcomes while managing quality, latency, and edge cases at scale.\n",
        "Before AI, I spent eight years building crypto infrastructure. At Anchorage I shipped ETF-grade staking for institutional clients including Galaxy and asset managers with billions in AUM. At Ankr I drove 15× revenue growth by pivoting our API platform to serve protocols like Polygon and Arbitrum. I started at Microsoft building Xbox royalties on Ethereum for 2.7B gaming consumers. Crypto.com's mission sits exactly at the intersection of my AI interest and crypto depth.\n"
