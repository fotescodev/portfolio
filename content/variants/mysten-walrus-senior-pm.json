I've shipped 7+ L2 integrations (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum) using a RICE evaluation framework I built, reducing integration time by 40%. Before that, at Ankr I drove 15× revenue growth ($130K to $2M ARR) by repositioning RPC infrastructure from developers to protocols—building Advanced APIs and an SDK that scaled to 1M+ daily requests. At Forte, I designed Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs with MPC custody for AAA gaming studios.",
        "At Dapper Labs, I led Flow CLI and Cadence Playground to reduce developer onboarding time by 60%. I started at Microsoft shipping Xbox royalties on Ethereum—one of the first production smart contracts in enterprise. Walrus's mission resonates deeply: I've spent my career making complex infrastructure accessible to developers, building the platforms that ecosystems depend on. I understand what it takes to evolve a protocol product from early adoption to production maturity while balancing performance, reliability, and developer experience."
