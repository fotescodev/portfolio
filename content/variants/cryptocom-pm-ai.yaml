    bio:
      - "I recently completed Product Faculty's AI Product Management certification (instructed by Miqdad Jaffer, product leader at OpenAI). I'm actively building AI-powered tooling—this portfolio runs on Claude-powered variant generation with full claim verification. I understand how to translate LLM capabilities into user outcomes while managing quality and edge cases at scale.\n"
      - "Before AI, I spent eight years building crypto infrastructure. At Anchorage I shipped ETF-grade staking for institutional clients including Galaxy and asset managers with billions in AUM. At Ankr I drove 15× revenue growth by pivoting our API platform to serve protocols like Polygon and Arbitrum. I started at Microsoft building Xbox royalties on Ethereum for 2.7B gaming consumers. Crypto.com's mission sits exactly at the intersection of my AI interest and crypto depth.\n"
