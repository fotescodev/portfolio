    building products that bring crypto to Stripe's millions of merchants.


    Requirements:

    - 5+ years product management experience

    - Deep understanding of crypto/blockchain ecosystems

    - Experience with payments, fintech, or financial infrastructure

    - Track record shipping developer-facing APIs

    - Comfort with regulatory complexity\n"

  about:
    tagline: "Eight years shipping products where crypto complexity meets financial infrastructure—from Xbox royalties on Ethereum to institutional staking serving billions in AUM. Now focused on bringing crypto to mainstream payments.\n"
    bio:
      - "Currently at Anchorage Digital, I lead protocol integrations and staking products for institutional clients—Galaxy, ETF providers, and enterprises navigating crypto custody. I've shipped 7+ L2 integrations (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum) and built ETF-grade staking infrastructure with zero slashing events. Before that, I drove 15× revenue growth at Ankr by repositioning RPC infrastructure from developers to blockchain protocols—proving I can find PMF in crowded markets.\n"
      - "I started in enterprise blockchain at Microsoft, shipping Xbox royalties on Ethereum before \"Web3\" existed. I understand both sides: the compliance rigor that financial institutions demand, and the developer experience that drives crypto adoption. Stripe's position at the intersection of payments and crypto is exactly where I want to build.\n"
