        "Currently at Anchorage Digital, I lead protocol integrations and staking infrastructure serving institutional clients. I've shipped 7+ L2 integrations (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum) and built ETF-grade validator APIs—designing distributed systems that balance performance, security, and developer experience. Before that, I built MPC-based Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs at Forte for gaming studios, and Flow CLI/Cadence developer tools at Dapper Labs that reduced onboarding time by 60%.",
        "I started at Microsoft shipping Xbox royalties on Ethereum—one of the first production smart contracts in enterprise, requiring Docker/K8s orchestration for blockchain nodes. I'm deeply experienced in distributed systems, crypto protocols, and developer tooling. Gensyn's mission to democratize ML compute through decentralized infrastructure resonates with my background: I've lived at this intersection of blockchain, developer experience, and cutting-edge technology for years. Currently exploring AI agent orchestration as a passion project."
