      Senior PM with 8 years shipping Web3 developer infrastructure—from Wallet-as-a-Service
      at Forte to API platforms serving 1M+ daily requests at Ankr. I've built the exact
      stack Crossmint runs: wallets, APIs, SDKs, multi-chain infrastructure.

  about:
    tagline: >
      Eight years building the infrastructure layer that lets developers ship Web3 products
      without becoming blockchain experts.
    bio:
      - >
        I've spent my career at the intersection of developer platforms and crypto infrastructure.
        At Forte, I led Wallet-as-a-Service using MPC custody—the same architecture powering
        Crossmint's embedded wallets. At Ankr, I shipped Advanced APIs (NFT, Token, Query)
        serving 1M+ daily requests and drove 15× revenue growth by pivoting from commodity RPC
        to differentiated developer tools. At Dapper, I improved developer onboarding by 60%
        through CLI and tooling improvements. This is exactly what Crossmint does: make
        blockchain invisible so developers can focus on their products.
      - >
        Now at Anchorage Digital, I ship institutional-grade crypto infrastructure—ETH staking
        with zero slashing events, 7+ L2 integrations across chains like Base, Optimism, and
        Arbitrum. I understand both the developer experience that drives adoption and the
        enterprise rigor that wins MoneyGram and Visa as clients. With my AI Product Management
        Certificate and hands-on experience integrating AI tools, I'm ready to help Crossmint
        lead in agentic commerce.
