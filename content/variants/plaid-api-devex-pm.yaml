      API & Developer Experience PM with 8+ years shipping SDKs, APIs, and
      developer tools. From Flow CLI to Ankr's Advanced API serving 1M+ daily
      requests—I make complex infrastructure feel simple.

  about:
    tagline: >
      Eight years building developer platforms where technical depth meets developer
      empathy—from blockchain SDKs to API architectures powering millions of requests.
    bio:
      - >
        At Dapper Labs, I owned Developer Experience—shipping the Flow CLI and
        Cadence Playground redesign that reduced time-to-first-deploy by 60%.
        At Ankr, I built the Advanced API from 0→1 (17 methods across NFT, Token,
        Query APIs) serving 1M+ daily requests, plus the SDK suite (Ankr.js, Ankr.py,
        React Hooks) with 1,900+ weekly downloads. At Forte, I productized
        Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs for AAA gaming studios. I've spent years
        obsessing over API ergonomics, documentation clarity, and what makes
        developer onboarding feel effortless.
      - >
        Plaid's mission resonates deeply—I've lived the pain of fragmented financial
        data integration and understand how critical {{accent}}great developer
        experience{{/accent}} is for platform adoption. My fintech experience at
        Anchorage Digital (institutional custody APIs, ETF-grade infrastructure)
        combined with hands-on API/SDK building makes this role feel like a natural
        fit. I'm excited about defining the vision for how developers experience Plaid.
