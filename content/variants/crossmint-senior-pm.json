        "I've spent my career at the intersection of developer platforms and crypto infrastructure. At Forte, I led Wallet-as-a-Service using MPC custody—the same architecture powering Crossmint's embedded wallets. At Ankr, I shipped Advanced APIs (NFT, Token, Query) serving 1M+ daily requests and drove 15× revenue growth by pivoting from commodity RPC to differentiated developer tools. At Dapper, I improved developer onboarding by 60% through CLI and tooling improvements. This is exactly what Crossmint does: make blockchain invisible so developers can focus on their products.\n",
        "Now at Anchorage Digital, I ship institutional-grade crypto infrastructure—ETH staking with zero slashing events, 7+ L2 integrations across chains like Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum. I understand both the developer experience that drives adoption and the enterprise rigor that wins MoneyGram and Visa as clients. With my AI Product Management Certificate and hands-on experience integrating AI tools, I'm ready to help Crossmint lead in agentic commerce.\n"
