  about:
    tagline: "Eight years shipping infrastructure products, from enterprise blockchain to institutional custody.\n"
    bio:
      - "At Anchorage Digital, I lead cross-functional initiatives spanning custody, staking, and protocol integrations. I've shipped 7+ protocol integrations using a RICE evaluation framework I built, coordinating across 4+ teams and reducing cycle time by 40%. Before that, I drove 15× revenue growth at Ankr by pivoting RPC infrastructure from developers to protocols—data-driven product decisions with measurable outcomes.\n"
      - "My Microsoft chapter started in 2017, when I shipped one of Microsoft's first production smart contracts—the Xbox royalty tracking system on Ethereum. Zero disputed payments post-launch. The pattern became a reference implementation for Azure blockchain services. Eight years later, I'm still shipping infrastructure that has to work every time—and I'd love to bring that back to Microsoft.\n"
