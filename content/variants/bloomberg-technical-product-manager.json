        "Currently at Anchorage Digital, I lead protocol integrations and staking APIs for institutional clients—designing extensible frameworks that balance security, performance, and developer experience. I've shipped 7+ L2 protocol integrations (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum) with consistent API patterns that scale. Before that, I built Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs at Forte and Flow CLI/Cadence Playground developer tools at Dapper Labs—reducing time-to-first-deploy by 60%.\n",
        "I started at Microsoft shipping one of the first production smart contracts in enterprise—Xbox royalties on Ethereum, requiring Docker/K8s infrastructure and API design for non-technical stakeholders. I'm drawn to problems at the intersection of technical depth and organizational scale: defining platform standards, championing best practices, and building tools that make developers more productive. Bloomberg's focus on Terminal architecture, interoperability, and AI integration aligns perfectly with my experience.\n"
