At Dapper Labs, I led the Flow CLI and Cadence Playground redesign that cut developer onboarding time by 60%—turning a churning funnel into a growth engine. At Ankr, I built the Ankr.JS SDK and Advanced APIs that powered 1M+ daily requests, driving 15× revenue growth by making RPC infrastructure feel invisible. At Forte, I designed Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs that let AAA gaming studios add Web3 features without learning blockchain.\n",
