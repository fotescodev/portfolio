At Dapper Labs, I owned the Flow CLI and Cadence Playground, reducing time-to-first-deploy by 60% through relentless focus on developer onboarding. At Anchorage Digital, I work with institutional clients managing billions—Galaxy chose us for ETH staking specifically because the infrastructure I built met their compliance bar. That means presenting to CTOs on technical architecture and following up with their engineers on implementation details.\n",

I've lived the pain of fragmented tooling and know what it takes to drive adoption in engineering orgs—both bottoms-up with power users and top-down with engineering leadership. My startup experience (Ankr: 15× revenue growth, 5-person team, survival mode) means I know how to be {{accent}}scrappy and proactive{{/accent}}. I want to help enterprises unlock what Cursor can do for their teams.\n"
