  about:
    tagline: "Eight years shipping developer tools where technical depth meets developer empathy—from blockchain CLI experiences to SDK architectures serving millions of API calls.\n"
    bio:
      - "At Anchorage Digital, I lead protocol integrations serving institutional clients. Before that, I owned developer experience at Dapper Labs—shipping the Flow CLI and Cadence Playground redesign that reduced time-to-first-deploy by 60%. At Forte, I built Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs for AAA gaming studios. At Ankr, I created Ankr.JS and Advanced APIs that powered 1M+ daily requests. I've spent years thinking about developer onboarding, API ergonomics, and what makes tools feel intuitive.\n"
      - "I've used Figma professionally for years—it's genuinely how I think through product problems. The design-to-code gap is one I've lived on both sides: as a PM shipping developer tools, and as someone who relies on design systems to ship faster. Figma's mission to bridge that gap resonates deeply. I'm particularly excited about AI-enhanced workflows—I've been building AI agent orchestration as a side project and see real opportunity to make developers' lives easier.\n"
