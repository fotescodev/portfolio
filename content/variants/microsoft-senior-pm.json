Before that, I drove 15× revenue growth at Ankr by pivoting RPC infrastructure from developers to protocols—data-driven product decisions with measurable outcomes.\n",

The pattern became a reference implementation for Azure blockchain services. Eight years later, I'm still shipping infrastructure that has to work every time—and I'd love to bring that back to Microsoft.\n"
