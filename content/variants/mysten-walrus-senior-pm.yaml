  jobDescription: "Sr. Product Manager for Walrus, owning the core data platform and key product

    surfaces including Walrus Sites. Role sits at intersection of storage, data delivery,

    and developer experience. Responsible for developer-facing abstractions (APIs, SDKs,

    tooling, documentation), working with engineering on performance/scalability/reliability,

    and supporting internal teams + external partners adopting Walrus in production.


    Key requirements: 5+ years PM experience on technical platform/infrastructure products,

    proven ownership of ambiguous problems end-to-end, strong technical fluency with APIs/

    data flows/system design, experience leading multi-quarter initiatives. Nice to have:

    ecosystem shaping experience, content/media/AI/data monetization exposure, security/

    privacy/governance familiarity, open-source involvement.\n"

    subheadline: "Senior PM with 8+ years building infrastructure products developers love. From RPC APIs serving 1M+ daily requests to SDK ecosystems for gaming studios— I turn complex distributed systems into reliable, scalable platforms. Passionate about the intersection of storage, data delivery, and developer experience.\n"
  about:
    tagline: "Eight years shipping infrastructure products that developers build on—from enterprise blockchain at Microsoft to institutional staking platforms. I find PMF in technical markets and turn engineering excellence into developer adoption.\n"
    bio:
      - "Currently at Anchorage Digital, I own staking infrastructure serving billions in AUM with zero slashing events. I've shipped 7+ L2 integrations (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum) using a RICE evaluation framework I built, reducing integration time by 40%. Before that, at Ankr I drove 15× revenue growth ($130K to $2M ARR) by repositioning RPC infrastructure from developers to protocols—building Advanced APIs and an SDK that scaled to 1M+ daily requests. At Forte, I designed Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs with MPC custody for AAA gaming studios.\n"
      - "At Dapper Labs, I led Flow CLI and Cadence Playground to reduce developer onboarding time by 60%. I started at Microsoft shipping Xbox royalties on Ethereum—one of the first production smart contracts in enterprise. Walrus's mission resonates deeply: I've spent my career making complex infrastructure accessible to developers, building the platforms that ecosystems depend on. I understand what it takes to evolve a protocol product from early adoption to production maturity while balancing performance, reliability, and developer experience.\n"
