      Technical Program Manager with 8+ years shipping Web3 infrastructure.
      From Microsoft's first blockchain project to institutional custody at Anchorage—
      where Galaxy chose us for staking. I turn cross-functional complexity into
      shipped products.

  about:
    tagline: >
      Eight years shipping Web3 infrastructure, from dev tools to institutional custody.
    bio:
      - >
        At Anchorage Digital, I lead cross-functional initiatives spanning custody,
        staking, and protocol integrations. I've shipped 7+ L2 integrations (Optimism,
        Base, Arbitrum) using a RICE evaluation framework I built, coordinating across
        4+ teams and reducing integration time by 40%. Galaxy chose Anchorage for ETH
        staking specifically because of the institutional-grade infrastructure my team
        built—zero slashing events, billions in AUM, full key ownership.
      - >
        I've been in Web3 since 2017, when I shipped one of Microsoft's first blockchain
        projects—Xbox royalty tracking on Ethereum. Eight years later, I'm still here
        because {{accent}}this is Web3's moment{{/accent}}—and Galaxy is positioned to
        define how institutions participate. I understand what it takes to lead global
        teams through complex, compliance-driven initiatives while maintaining velocity.
