  about:
    tagline: "Eight years shipping developer tools that bridge the gap between powerful infrastructure and delightful DX.\n"
    bio:
      - "I've spent my career making complex infrastructure accessible to developers. At Dapper Labs, I led the Flow CLI and Cadence Playground redesign that cut developer onboarding time by 60%—turning a churning funnel into a growth engine. At Ankr, I built the Ankr.JS SDK and Advanced APIs that powered 1M+ daily requests, driving 15× revenue growth by making RPC infrastructure feel invisible. At Forte, I designed Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs that let AAA gaming studios add Web3 features without learning blockchain.\n"
      - "What excites me about Anaconda is the {{accent}}MCP and agentic systems work{{/accent}}. I've been deep in AI-assisted development—using Cursor and Claude daily, building my own MCP servers, and thinking hard about what developer tools look like when agents are first-class users. The opportunity to shape how 50M+ Python developers interact with AI tools is exactly where I want to be.\n"
