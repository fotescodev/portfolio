      Technical Product Manager building empathy through Developer Experience.
      From Microsoft to institutional crypto infrastructure, I bridge the gap
      between technical depth and enterprise trust.

  about:
    tagline: >
      Eight years driving developer adoption at the intersection of technical depth
      and enterprise trust—from SDKs to institutional infrastructure.
    bio:
      - >
        I've spent my career making complex infrastructure accessible to developers
        while earning the trust of their leadership. Most recently, at Anchorage Digital, I worked with
        institutional clients managing billions in AUM, ensuring zero slashing events
        through reliable staking infrastructure. At Ankr, I drove 15× revenue growth
        ($130K to $2M ARR) by repositioning RPC infrastructure from developers to protocols—
        building Advanced APIs and an SDK that scaled to 1M+ daily requests.
      - >
        What draws me to Cursor is the developer productivity mission. I've lived
        the pain of fragmented developer tooling.I want to help enterprises {{accent}}unlock what Cursor
        can do{{/accent}} for their teams.
