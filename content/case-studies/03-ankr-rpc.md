No product-market fit meant the RPC product would get shut down or sold off. Team jobs were on the line.

## The Challenge

Ankr's RPC infrastructure was underutilized and treated as a commodity. Competing on price with Infura and Alchemy in the developer segment was a race to the bottom. Needed differentiation and a sustainable business model.

The constraints:
- 5 engineers total
- Infura and Alchemy owned developer mindshare
- RPC is inherently commoditized—hard to differentiate on features
- Developer segment has high churn and low willingness to pay

## The Approach

The bet: blockchain protocols have different needs than individual developers. They need reliable infrastructure for their entire ecosystems, have longer sales cycles but higher LTV, and will pay premium for partnership-level support.

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Double down on developer DX | Large market, existing user base | Couldn't out-Alchemy Alchemy—they had 10x our resources |
| Pivot to enterprise (non-crypto) | Higher contract values | Sales cycle too long for our runway |
| Build specialized APIs | Higher margins, less commoditized | Good complement but not standalone business |

We pivoted to B2B protocol sales while building Advanced APIs as differentiation. Protocols became our core customer; developers became their users.

## Key Decision

**B2B pivot: protocols over developers**

Team was attached to developer-first identity. Pivot felt like abandoning our roots.

Shifted primary customer from developers to protocols. Developers became users we served through protocol partnerships.

> Protocols had 10x LTV of developer accounts. One protocol deal = 100 developer signups in revenue. Unit economics finally worked.

## Execution

### Phase 1: Customer Discovery (4 weeks)
- 15+ interviews with blockchain protocol teams about infrastructure pain points
- Key insight: protocols were stitching together multiple providers
- Mapped competitive landscape and pricing for protocol-tier contracts

### Phase 2: Product Repositioning (3 weeks)
- Pricing redesigned with protocol-tier and SLA guarantees
- Partnership program with dedicated support channels
- Case studies from early protocol conversations

### Phase 3: Advanced APIs Development (8 weeks)
- Shipped Ankr Advanced APIs (NFT, token, query APIs)
- Ankr.JS SDK for improved developer experience
- Usage analytics dashboard for protocol partners

### Phase 4: Go-to-Market (Ongoing)
- Outbound sales targeting protocol BD teams
- Content marketing around protocol infrastructure needs
- Referral program where protocols recommended us to their developers

## Results

- **15× revenue growth** — From ~$130K to $2M ARR in 8 months
- **$2M ARR in 6 months** — Target that seemed impossible at start
- **1M+ daily API requests** — Usage scaled with protocol partnerships

Proved B2B model works for infrastructure products. Ankr raised additional funding citing this traction. Team avoided layoffs that hit other crypto companies.

## What I Learned

**What worked:**
- Customer interviews revealed insight competitors missed—protocols were underserved
- Protocol partnerships created network effects (their developers became our users)
- Advanced APIs gave us differentiation beyond commodity RPC
- SLA guarantees justified premium pricing developers wouldn't pay

**What didn't:**
- Priced protocol tier too low initially. Left money on the table with first 3 deals
- Ankr.JS SDK was over-engineered. Developers wanted simple examples, not comprehensive abstraction
- Spent too much time on marketing content that didn't convert. Direct outreach was 10x more effective

> In infrastructure, your customer isn't always your user. Finding the right customer segment can transform unit economics overnight.

If I did it again: start outbound sales 4 weeks earlier. We waited for "perfect" product when good-enough product with strong sales motion would have accelerated revenue.
