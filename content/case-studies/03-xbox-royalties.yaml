# CONTEXT - Role clarity
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
context:
  myRole: "Software Engineer → Technical PM"
  teamSize: "4 engineers"
  duration: "2 years"
  stakeholders:
    - "Xbox store platform team"
    - "Game publisher partners"
    - "Microsoft finance and legal"
    - "Azure blockchain services"

# PROBLEM - Make them feel the pain
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
problem:
  businessContext: >
    Xbox needed a transparent, auditable system for tracking and distributing
    royalty payments to game publishers. Existing database systems lacked
    the auditability needed for complex multi-party royalty calculations
    where publishers disputed payment accuracy.
  constraints:
    - "Must handle Xbox-scale transaction volumes (millions of purchases)"
    - "Publishers need real-time visibility into royalty accruals"
    - "Audit trail must be immutable and independently verifiable"
    - "Can't expose transaction data to competitors (privacy requirements)"
  stakes: >
    Royalty disputes with major publishers were costing millions in legal
    fees and damaging relationships. A transparent system could eliminate
    disputes entirely.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# APPROACH - Show thinking depth
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
approach:
  hypothesis: >
    A blockchain-based system would provide the immutability and transparency
    publishers needed, while smart contracts could automate complex royalty
    calculations that were error-prone when done manually.
  alternatives:
    - option: "Enhanced traditional database with audit logging"
      tradeoffs: "Simpler, uses existing infrastructure, faster to build"
      whyNot: "Publishers didn't trust Microsoft-controlled audit logs. They wanted independent verification."
    - option: "Public Ethereum mainnet"
      tradeoffs: "Maximum transparency, decentralization"
      whyNot: "Transaction data couldn't be public—competitor intelligence risk. Also gas costs at scale were prohibitive."
    - option: "Third-party blockchain platform (Hyperledger)"
      tradeoffs: "Enterprise-ready, permissioned by design"
      whyNot: "Wanted to stay in Ethereum ecosystem for tooling and talent. Private consortium gave us the best of both."
  chosenPath: "Private Ethereum consortium with permissioned access, maintaining Ethereum compatibility for tooling while ensuring transaction privacy."

# EXECUTION - Concrete actions
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
execution:
  phases:
    - name: "Proof of Concept"
      duration: "3 months"
      actions:
        - "Built initial smart contract for basic royalty calculation logic"
        - "Demonstrated to Xbox leadership that blockchain could handle required throughput"
        - "Identified key technical risks: key management, network consensus, data privacy"
    - name: "Infrastructure Build"
      duration: "6 months"
      actions:
        - "Designed Docker/Kubernetes architecture for blockchain consortium nodes"
        - "Built deployment automation for multi-node Ethereum network on Azure"
        - "Created key management system integrated with Azure Key Vault"
    - name: "Smart Contract Development"
      duration: "4 months"
      actions:
        - "Developed Solidity contracts for royalty tracking and distribution"
        - "Built comprehensive testing framework for smart contract validation"
        - "Created publisher onboarding flow with role-based access control"
    - name: "Integration & Testing"
      duration: "6 months"
      actions:
        - "Integrated with Xbox store transaction pipeline"
        - "Ran parallel processing with existing system for validation"
        - "Conducted security audit with external blockchain specialists"
  keyDecision:
    title: "Private consortium vs. public Ethereum"
    context: "Some stakeholders pushed for public chain for 'true decentralization.' Publishers were concerned about data exposure."
    decision: "Chose private consortium. Gave publishers what they actually needed (independent verification) without exposing competitive data."
    outcome: "Publishers got audit capability they wanted. No data exposure incidents. Pattern became template for other Microsoft blockchain projects."

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RESULTS - Quantified impact
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
results:
  primary:
    metric: "First smart contract at Microsoft"
    context: "Pioneered enterprise blockchain adoption before 'Web3' existed as a term"
  secondary:
    metric: "Xbox-scale transaction processing"
    context: "System capable of handling millions of royalty calculations"
  tertiary:
    metric: "Zero disputed payments post-launch"
    context: "Transparent audit trail eliminated publisher payment disputes"
  qualitative: >
    Project became reference implementation for Azure blockchain services.
    Established internal expertise that informed Microsoft's broader blockchain strategy.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# REFLECTION - Shows self-awareness
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
reflection:
  whatWorked:
    - "Starting with POC that proved throughput—eliminated 'blockchain can't scale' objection early"
    - "Private consortium satisfied both transparency AND privacy requirements"
    - "Docker/K8s infrastructure made deployment reproducible and auditable"
    - "Comprehensive testing framework caught bugs before production"
  whatDidnt:
    - "Underestimated key management complexity. Spent 3 extra months on secure key handling that should have been scoped from start."
    - "Initially tried to build everything in-house. Should have leveraged Azure blockchain services earlier."
    - "Solidity developer talent was scarce in 2016. Had to train existing team, which slowed development."
  lessonLearned: >
    Enterprise blockchain adoption is 20% technical and 80% organizational.
    The hard part isn't building the system—it's convincing stakeholders
    to trust a new paradigm.
  wouldDoDifferently: >
    Would have brought in a blockchain specialist consultant for the first
    3 months. Learning Solidity security patterns through trial and error
    was risky and slow.
