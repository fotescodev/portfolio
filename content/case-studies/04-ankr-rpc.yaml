# CONTEXT - Role clarity
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
context:
  myRole: "Product Manager"
  teamSize: "5 engineers"
  duration: "8 months"
  stakeholders:
    - "Protocol BD teams (potential customers)"
    - "Individual developers (existing users)"
    - "Engineering and infrastructure"
    - "Marketing and growth"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROBLEM - Make them feel the pain
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
problem:
  businessContext: >
    Ankr's RPC infrastructure was underutilized and treated as a commodity.
    Competing on price with Infura and Alchemy in the developer segment
    was a race to the bottom. The product needed differentiation and a
    sustainable business model.
  constraints:
    - "Limited engineering resources (5 engineers total)"
    - "Established competitors with strong developer brand (Infura, Alchemy)"
    - "RPC is inherently commoditized—hard to differentiate on features"
    - "Developer segment has high churn and low willingness to pay"
  stakes: >
    Without finding product-market fit, the RPC product would be shut down
    or sold off. Team jobs were on the line.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# APPROACH - Show thinking depth
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
approach:
  hypothesis: >
    Blockchain protocols have different needs than individual developers:
    they need reliable infrastructure for their entire ecosystems, have
    longer sales cycles but higher LTV, and would pay premium for
    partnership-level support.
  alternatives:
    - option: "Double down on developer segment with better DX"
      tradeoffs: "Large market, familiar go-to-market, existing user base"
      whyNot: "We couldn't out-Alchemy Alchemy. They had 10x our resources and established developer love."
    - option: "Pivot to enterprise (non-crypto)"
      tradeoffs: "Higher contract values, less competition"
      whyNot: "Sales cycle too long for our runway. Enterprise blockchain adoption was still nascent."
    - option: "Build specialized APIs (NFT, DeFi data)"
      tradeoffs: "Higher margins, less commoditized"
      whyNot: "Good complement to core strategy, but not a standalone business. Became part of our B2B offering."
  chosenPath: "Pivot to B2B protocol sales while building Advanced APIs as differentiation. Protocols became our core customer segment; developers became their users."

# EXECUTION - Concrete actions
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
execution:
  phases:
    - name: "Customer Discovery"
      duration: "4 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Interviewed 15+ blockchain protocol teams about infrastructure pain points"
        - "Identified key insight: protocols were stitching together multiple providers"
        - "Mapped competitive landscape and pricing for protocol-tier contracts"
    - name: "Product Repositioning"
      duration: "3 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Redesigned pricing to include protocol-tier with SLA guarantees"
        - "Created partnership program with dedicated support channels"
        - "Built case studies from early protocol conversations"
    - name: "Advanced APIs Development"
      duration: "8 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Designed and shipped Ankr Advanced APIs (NFT, token, query APIs)"
        - "Created Ankr.JS SDK for improved developer experience"
        - "Built usage analytics dashboard for protocol partners"
    - name: "Go-to-Market"
      duration: "Ongoing"
      actions:
        - "Launched outbound sales motion targeting protocol BD teams"
        - "Created content marketing around protocol infrastructure needs"
        - "Built referral program where protocols recommended us to their developers"
  keyDecision:
    title: "B2B pivot: protocols over developers"
    context: "Team was attached to developer-first identity. Pivot felt like abandoning our roots."
    decision: "Shifted primary customer from developers to protocols. Developers became users we served through protocol partnerships."
    outcome: "Protocols had 10x LTV of developer accounts. One protocol deal = 100 developer signups in revenue. Unit economics finally worked."

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RESULTS - Quantified impact
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
results:
  primary:
    metric: "15× revenue growth"
    context: "From ~$130K to $2M ARR in 8 months"
  secondary:
    metric: "$2M ARR in 6 months"
    context: "Achieved target that seemed impossible at start"
  tertiary:
    metric: "1M+ daily API requests"
    context: "Usage scaled with protocol partnerships"
  qualitative: >
    Proved the B2B model worked for infrastructure products. Ankr later
    raised additional funding citing this traction. Team avoided layoffs
    that hit other crypto companies.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# REFLECTION - Shows self-awareness
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
reflection:
  whatWorked:
    - "Customer interviews revealed insight competitors missed—protocols were underserved"
    - "Protocol partnerships created network effects (their developers became our users)"
    - "Advanced APIs gave us differentiation beyond commodity RPC"
    - "SLA guarantees justified premium pricing that developers wouldn't pay"
  whatDidnt:
    - "Initially priced protocol tier too low. Left money on the table with first 3 deals. Should have tested pricing more aggressively."
    - "Ankr.JS SDK was over-engineered. Developers wanted simple examples, not comprehensive abstraction."
    - "Spent too much time on marketing content that didn't convert. Direct outreach was 10x more effective."
  lessonLearned: >
    In infrastructure, your customer isn't always your user. Finding the
    right customer segment can transform unit economics overnight.
  wouldDoDifferently: >
    Would have started outbound sales 4 weeks earlier. We waited for
    'perfect' product when good-enough product with strong sales motion
    would have accelerated revenue.
