# CONTEXT - Role clarity
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
context:
  myRole: "Senior Product Manager"
  teamSize: "Cross-functional (8+ across teams)"
  duration: "Ongoing"
  stakeholders:
    - "Protocol BD teams (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum)"
    - "Internal engineering (blockchain, security, custody)"
    - "Compliance and legal"
    - "Institutional clients requesting specific chains"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROBLEM - Make them feel the pain
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
problem:
  businessContext: >
    Rapid L2 ecosystem growth meant constant requests to support new chains.
    Each integration required coordination across 4+ internal teams and
    external protocol teams—with no standardized process. We were leaving
    revenue on the table while competitors moved faster.
  constraints:
    - "Each protocol has unique security models requiring custom evaluation"
    - "Compliance review bottleneck—single reviewer for all protocols"
    - "Engineering bandwidth split across maintenance and new integrations"
    - "Client pressure to support 'hot' new chains immediately"
  stakes: >
    Without a scalable process, we'd either integrate risky protocols too
    fast (compliance failure) or move too slow and lose institutional
    clients to competitors with broader chain support.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# APPROACH - Show thinking depth
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
approach:
  hypothesis: >
    A standardized evaluation framework would let us say 'no' confidently
    to 60% of requests while fast-tracking high-value integrations—turning
    our bottleneck into a competitive advantage of 'institutional rigor.'
  alternatives:
    - option: "Case-by-case evaluation (status quo)"
      tradeoffs: "Flexible, allows for context-specific decisions"
      whyNot: "Didn't scale. Each integration took 12+ weeks with no predictability. Teams were constantly context-switching."
    - option: "Outsource protocol research to third party"
      tradeoffs: "Faster initial assessment, frees internal resources"
      whyNot: "Security evaluation couldn't be outsourced—institutional clients needed our stamp of approval, not a vendor's."
    - option: "Only support top 5 chains by TVL"
      tradeoffs: "Simplest approach, reduced complexity"
      whyNot: "Client demand was for emerging chains (Base, Arbitrum). Top 5 only strategy would lose us differentiation."
  chosenPath: "Built RICE-based evaluation framework with parallel workstreams: security, compliance, and engineering running simultaneously rather than sequentially."

# EXECUTION - Concrete actions
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
execution:
  phases:
    - name: "Framework Design"
      duration: "3 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Audited previous 5 integrations to identify bottlenecks and common failure modes"
        - "Created RICE scoring criteria: Reach (client demand), Impact (revenue), Confidence (security), Effort (eng complexity)"
        - "Designed parallel evaluation tracks so compliance doesn't block engineering research"
    - name: "Stakeholder Alignment"
      duration: "2 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Presented framework to engineering, compliance, and BD leadership"
        - "Negotiated SLAs: 2-week initial assessment, 6-week full integration"
        - "Created RACI matrix clarifying who owns each evaluation component"
    - name: "Pilot & Iteration"
      duration: "4 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Piloted framework with Base and Arbitrum integrations running in parallel"
        - "Identified gaps: needed better handoff documentation between teams"
        - "Added 'integration playbook' template based on pilot learnings"
    - name: "Scale & Operationalize"
      duration: "Ongoing"
      actions:
        - "Shipped 7+ protocols using framework (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Plume, Citrea, BOB, Aztec)"
        - "Trained BD team to do initial RICE scoring before escalating to PM"
        - "Created monthly 'protocol health' review for ongoing risk monitoring"
  keyDecision:
    title: "Build framework vs. hire more people"
    context: "Initial instinct was to request additional headcount. Leadership asked for process improvement first."
    decision: "Built framework that reduced per-integration effort by 40%, making existing team 2x more effective without new hires."
    outcome: "Framework became template for other product teams. Saved estimated $200K in hiring costs while increasing throughput."

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# RESULTS - Quantified impact
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
results:
  primary:
    metric: "7+ protocols shipped"
    context: "Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Plume, Citrea, BOB, Aztec—mix of established and emerging chains"
  secondary:
    metric: "40% faster integration"
    context: "From 12+ weeks average to ~7 weeks for standard integrations"
  tertiary:
    metric: "3 parallel launches"
    context: "First time we shipped multiple protocols simultaneously"
  qualitative: >
    Framework became company standard. BD team now self-serves on initial
    evaluation, reducing PM involvement in early stages by 60%.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# REFLECTION - Shows self-awareness
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
reflection:
  whatWorked:
    - "RICE framework gave us language to say 'no' without it feeling arbitrary"
    - "Parallel workstreams eliminated the 'waiting on compliance' blocker"
    - "Playbook template reduced 'how do we do this again?' overhead"
    - "Monthly health reviews caught one protocol degradation before client impact"
  whatDidnt:
    - "Initial framework was too complex—had 15 evaluation criteria. Simplified to 8 after feedback that teams weren't using it."
    - "Didn't involve BD early enough. They felt blindsided by framework that affected their conversations with protocols."
    - "Underestimated documentation maintenance burden. Playbooks got stale without dedicated owner."
  lessonLearned: >
    The best frameworks are ones people actually use. Simplicity beats
    comprehensiveness. If you need a training session to explain it, it's
    too complex.
  wouldDoDifferently: >
    Would start with BD as co-creators of the framework, not recipients of it.
    Their buy-in earlier would have accelerated adoption by weeks.
