# CONTEXT - Role clarity
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
context:
  myRole: "Senior Product Manager"
  teamSize: "6 engineers + compliance + legal"
  duration: "6 months"
  stakeholders:
    - "Galaxy Digital (client)"
    - "Internal compliance & legal teams"
    - "Validator infrastructure engineering"
    - "External auditors"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# PROBLEM - Make them feel the pain
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
problem:
  businessContext: >
    ETF providers and asset managers wanted ETH staking yield, but couldn't
    use existing solutions. Consumer staking products lacked the custody
    controls, audit trails, and regulatory defensibility that institutional
    clients require.
  constraints:
    - "Full custody key ownership required (no third-party key management)"
    - "Must pass SOC 2 and regulatory audits"
    - "Zero tolerance for slashing events (millions at stake per incident)"
    - "Competitive yield expectations within 0.1% of market"
  stakes: >
    Losing a single institutional client to a slashing event or compliance
    failure would damage reputation across the entire institutional market—
    a market where trust spreads by word of mouth.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# APPROACH - Show thinking depth
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
approach:
  hypothesis: >
    We could build in-house validator infrastructure that satisfies
    institutional custody requirements while maintaining competitive yields—
    if we optimized for 'boring and defensible' over 'innovative and risky.'
  alternatives:
    - option: "Third-party staking provider (Figment, Blockdaemon, Kiln)"
      tradeoffs: "Faster launch (weeks vs months), battle-tested infra, lower operational burden"
      whyNot: "Custody key control was non-negotiable for ETF-grade compliance. Third parties couldn't provide the audit trail our clients required."
    - option: "Single validator client (Prysm only)"
      tradeoffs: "Simpler operations, unified tooling, faster debugging"
      whyNot: "Network centralization risk + institutional mandate for resilience. A client-specific bug could take down 100% of validators."
    - option: "Maximum yield optimization (MEV boost, aggressive strategies)"
      tradeoffs: "Higher APY, competitive differentiation"
      whyNot: "Introduced unpredictability that institutional clients explicitly didn't want. They valued consistency over maximization."
  chosenPath: "In-house multi-client infrastructure with Web3Signer for air-gapped signing, prioritizing auditability and slashing prevention over yield maximization."

# EXECUTION - Concrete actions
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
execution:
  phases:
    - name: "Discovery & Requirements"
      duration: "6 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Conducted 12+ calls with Galaxy and prospective institutional clients to understand non-negotiables"
        - "Mapped compliance requirements with legal and created 'custody compatibility matrix'"
        - "Evaluated 3 staking-as-a-service providers against institutional requirements"
    - name: "Architecture & Design"
      duration: "4 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Designed multi-client validator architecture (Lighthouse 40%, Prysm 30%, Teku 20%, Nimbus 10%)"
        - "Specified Web3Signer integration for air-gapped signing with slashing protection"
        - "Created redundant slashing DB architecture with multiple sources of truth"
    - name: "Build & Integration"
      duration: "8 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Coordinated engineering sprints across validator infra and custody integration teams"
        - "Built sub-second alert systems for potential slashing scenarios"
        - "Implemented 'graceful degradation' logic—miss attestations rather than risk slashing"
    - name: "Client Onboarding & Iteration"
      duration: "6 weeks"
      actions:
        - "Onboarded Galaxy as design partner, incorporating feedback into MVP"
        - "Created operational runbooks for every failure scenario"
        - "Documented every architecture decision for audit trail"
  keyDecision:
    title: "In-house validators vs. staking-as-a-service"
    context: "Staking providers offered 3-week launch vs our 6-month build. Leadership pressure to ship faster."
    decision: "Chose in-house despite timeline. Presented compliance risk matrix showing third-party key management as audit blocker for ETF clients."
    outcome: "Decision validated when Galaxy specifically cited 'full key ownership' as reason they chose us over competitors using third-party providers."

# RESULTS - Quantified impact
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
results:
  primary:
    metric: "Zero slashing events"
    context: "Across all validators since launch—the only metric that matters for institutional trust"
  secondary:
    metric: "Galaxy + institutional clients onboarded"
    context: "Including ETF-adjacent asset managers with billions in AUM"
  tertiary:
    metric: "Yield within 0.1% of market leaders"
    context: "Proved we didn't sacrifice performance for compliance"
  qualitative: >
    Established Anchorage as credible institutional staking provider.
    Created reusable compliance framework now used for other staking products.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# REFLECTION - Shows self-awareness (critical for credibility)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
reflection:
  whatWorked:
    - "Involving compliance from day 1, not as a checkbox at the end"
    - "Using Galaxy as design partner—their feedback caught edge cases we missed"
    - "Building extensive documentation as we went (invaluable for audits)"
    - "Choosing 'boring and defensible' over clever optimizations"
  whatDidnt:
    - "Initially underestimated validator client diversity overhead—each client has different APIs, DBs, upgrade cycles. Should have scoped this as a separate workstream."
    - "First slashing prevention design was over-engineered. Built for scenarios that were theoretically possible but practically irrelevant. Simplified after eng feedback."
    - "Took too long to align legal and compliance on key custody definitions. Should have forced alignment in week 1, not week 4."
  lessonLearned: >
    In regulated crypto infrastructure, the competitive moat isn't technical
    innovation—it's trust, auditability, and the paper trail that proves
    you did things right.
  wouldDoDifferently: >
    Would run a 'compliance design review' as a formal gate before any
    architecture decisions. We did this informally, but making it explicit
    would have saved 2-3 weeks of rework.
