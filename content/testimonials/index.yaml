      I had the chance to work alongside Dimitri on blockchain protocol and staking initiatives. He brings meaningful protocol and blockchain depth and a thoughtful, low-ego approach to collaboration. Dimitri communicates clearly, shows up reliably, and is always willing to jump in and support his team when needed. He’d be a strong addition to any technical product organization.

      Dmitrii has a unique ability to bring a product ownership mindset to extremely technical challenges, almost like a technical project manager that was equal parts product owner. I can always rely on Dmitrii to break down a complex protocol and the product implications of one approach vs another. Crypto, SSI, Identity, Protocols - building with Dmitrii is always collaborative and always enlightening.
