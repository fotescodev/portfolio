headline: "Built AI evaluation pipeline with claims verification, red-team adversarial testing, and multi-layer quality gates for LLM-generated content"

metric:
  value: "8"
  unit: "automated security checks"
  context: "Red team pipeline catches prompt injection, metric inflation, hallucinations, and cross-contamination before deployment"

situation: |
  AI-generated content carries significant risk: hallucinated achievements, inflated metrics,
  and unverifiable claims can destroy credibility. Existing LLM tooling focuses on generation,
  not verification. Needed a system that could scale personalized content while maintaining
  interview-defensible accuracy for every claim.

task: |
  Design and implement an end-to-end evaluation framework that:
  1. Traces every AI-generated claim to source data
  2. Catches common LLM failure modes before deployment
  3. Enables human-in-the-loop verification at scale
  4. Integrates with CI/CD for automated quality gates

action: |
  Built a multi-layer evaluation system:

  **Claims Extraction & Verification:**
  - Automated extraction of quantifiable statements (metrics, percentages, counts)
  - Token-based source matching against knowledge base
  - Machine-checkable ledger with content hash tracking for regression detection
  - CLI tooling: `npm run eval:variant`, `npm run eval:check`

  **Red Team Security Pipeline:**
  - 8 automated checks: secrets scanning, prompt injection detection, sycophancy,
    metric inflation warnings, confidentiality leaks, cross-variant contamination
  - Threat model documentation covering 5 failure categories
  - Strict mode for CI/CD integration (`--strict` flag promotes warnings to failures)

  **Deterministic Pre-Processing:**
  - JD analysis filters 47+ generic phrases BEFORE AI processes content
  - Evidence search scores alignment against knowledge base
  - Reduces hallucination surface by constraining AI to verified data

  **Multi-Provider LLM Integration:**
  - Unified interface for Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini
  - Structured output validation via Zod schemas
  - Fallback handling and latency optimization

result: |
  Zero hallucinations in deployed variants—every metric traces to source data.
  4-dimension evaluation rubric (Accuracy, Relevance, Tone, Safety) with documented
  scoring criteria. Red team pipeline catches issues that manual review misses.
  All content is interview-defensible: can explain provenance of any claim.
  System runs as automated quality gates in development workflow.
