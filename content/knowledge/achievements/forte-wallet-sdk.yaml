headline: "Built Wallet-as-a-Service infrastructure with MPC custody for AAA gaming studios"

metric:
  value: "Multiple"
  unit: "AAA gaming partners"
  context: "SDK powering non-custodial wallets for major gaming studios"

situation: |
  Gaming studios wanted to integrate Web3 features (NFTs, tokens) but lacked
  blockchain expertise. Existing wallet solutions were either too complex for
  gamers (self-custody) or too centralized for regulatory comfort (custodial).

task: |
  Build Wallet-as-a-Service infrastructure that gaming studios could integrate
  easily while providing non-custodial security through MPC (multi-party computation).
  Design SDK for developer adoption.

action: |
  Designed MPC custody solution allowing key shares distributed across studio and
  player—non-custodial without seed phrase complexity. Built SDK abstracting wallet
  operations for gaming use cases. Created integration guides for major game engines.
  Worked with legal on regulatory positioning.

result: |
  Launched SDK used by multiple AAA gaming partners. Enabled gaming studios to
  add Web3 features without blockchain expertise. MPC architecture satisfied
  regulatory requirements while maintaining user experience.
