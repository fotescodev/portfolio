id: eth-staking-zero-slashing
headline: "Built ETF-grade staking infrastructure with zero slashing events for institutional clients managing billions in AUM"

metric:
  value: "Zero"
  unit: "slashing events"
  context: "Billions in AUM at stake; single slashing event would damage reputation across institutional market"

situation: |
  ETF providers and asset managers wanted ETH staking yield but couldn't use existing
  consumer solutions. Products lacked custody controls, audit trails, and regulatory
  defensibility required by institutions. Losing a single client to slashing or
  compliance failure would damage reputation across the entire institutional market.

task: |
  Build in-house validator infrastructure satisfying institutional custody requirements
  (full key ownership, SOC 2 compliant, zero slashing tolerance) while maintaining
  competitive yields within 0.1% of market.

action: |
  Chose in-house validators over 3-week staking-as-a-service launch despite leadership
  timeline pressure. Presented compliance risk matrix showing third-party key management
  as audit blocker. Designed multi-client architecture (Lighthouse 40%, Prysm 30%,
  Teku 20%, Nimbus 10%) with Web3Signer for air-gapped signing. Built redundant
  slashing DB with graceful degradation—miss attestations rather than risk slashing.

result: |
  Zero slashing events across all validators since launch. Galaxy specifically cited
  'full key ownership' as reason they chose us over competitors. Onboarded Galaxy +
  ETF-adjacent asset managers with billions in AUM. Yield within 0.1% of market leaders.
  Created reusable compliance framework for other staking products.
