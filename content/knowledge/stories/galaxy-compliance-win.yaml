title: "How 'Boring and Defensible' Won Galaxy's Business"
type: case-study

hook: |
  Galaxy specifically cited 'full key ownership' as the reason they chose us over
  competitors using third-party staking providers. The decision we almost didn't make.

narrative:
  problem: |
    ETF providers and asset managers wanted ETH staking yield but couldn't use
    existing solutions. Consumer staking products lacked the custody controls,
    audit trails, and regulatory defensibility that institutional clients require.
    Losing a single institutional client to a slashing event would damage reputation
    across the entire market—a market where trust spreads by word of mouth.

  insight: |
    Third-party staking providers offered 3-week launch vs our 6-month build.
    Leadership pressure to ship faster. But when I mapped compliance risk against
    client requirements, third-party key management was a clear audit blocker for
    ETF-grade clients. The faster path was actually the wrong path.

  approach: |
    Chose in-house validators despite timeline pressure. Presented compliance risk
    matrix to leadership showing the regulatory exposure. Designed for "boring and
    defensible" over "innovative and risky"—multi-client validator architecture
    with Web3Signer for air-gapped signing, prioritizing auditability and slashing
    prevention over yield maximization.

  execution: |
    12+ discovery calls with Galaxy and prospective institutional clients to map
    non-negotiables. Created 'custody compatibility matrix' with legal. Designed
    multi-client architecture (Lighthouse 40%, Prysm 30%, Teku 20%, Nimbus 10%).
    Built redundant slashing DB with 'graceful degradation'—miss attestations
    rather than risk slashing. Onboarded Galaxy as design partner.

  outcome: |
    Zero slashing events since launch—the only metric that matters for institutional
    trust. Galaxy + multiple ETF-adjacent clients onboarded. Yield within 0.1% of
    market leaders—proved we didn't sacrifice performance for compliance. Established
    Anchorage as credible institutional staking provider.

  reflection: |
    In regulated crypto infrastructure, the competitive moat isn't technical
    innovation—it's trust, auditability, and the paper trail that proves you did
    things right. If I did it again, I'd run a 'compliance design review' as a
    formal gate before any architecture decisions.
