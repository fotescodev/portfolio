_**User (sidechain)**_

I need to create a Claude Code Skill for "Universal CV Data Ingestion & Organization". 

Please provide:
1. The exact file format and location for Claude Code Skills
2. The schema/structure required for a skill definition
3. Best practices for skill prompts
4. How to handle parameters/arguments in skills
5. Example of a complete skill file

I want to create a skill that helps users ingest raw career data (Obsidian notes, CSV files, etc.) and organize it into a structured portfolio content system.

# Agent Skills

> Create, manage, and share Skills to extend Claude's capabilities in Claude Code.

This guide shows you how to create, use, and manage Agent Skills in Claude Code. Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality through organized folders containing instructions, scripts, and resources.

## Prerequisites

* Claude Code version 1.0 or later
* Basic familiarity with [Claude Code](/en/quickstart)

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills package expertise into discoverable capabilities. Each Skill consists of a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that Claude reads when relevant, plus optional supporting files like scripts and templates.

**How Skills are invoked**: Skills are **model-invoked**—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description. This is different from slash commands, which are **user-invoked** (you explicitly type `/command` to trigger them).

**Benefits**:

* Extend Claude's capabilities for your specific workflows
* Share expertise across your team via git
* Reduce repetitive prompting
* Compose multiple Skills for complex tasks

Learn more in the [Agent Skills overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

<Note>
  For a deep dive into the architecture and real-world applications of Agent Skills, read our engineering blog: [Equipping agents for the real world with Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills).
</Note>

## Create a Skill

Skills are stored as directories containing a `SKILL.md` file.

### Personal Skills

Personal Skills are available across all your projects. Store them in `~/.claude/skills/`:

\```bash  theme={null}
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill-name
\```

**Use personal Skills for**:

* Your individual workflows and preferences
* Experimental Skills you're developing
* Personal productivity tools

### Project Skills

Project Skills are shared with your team. Store them in `.claude/skills/` within your project:

\```bash  theme={null}
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill-name
\```

**Use project Skills for**:

* Team workflows and conventions
* Project-specific expertise
* Shared utilities and scripts

Project Skills are checked into git and automatically available to team members.

### Plugin Skills

Skills can also come from [Claude Code plugins](/en/plugins). Plugins may bundle Skills that are automatically available when the plugin is installed. These Skills work the same way as personal and project Skills.

## Write SKILL.md

Create a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and Markdown content:

\```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this Skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Name

## Instructions
Provide clear, step-by-step guidance for Claude.

## Examples
Show concrete examples of using this Skill.
\```

**Field requirements**:

* `name`: Must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only (max 64 characters)
* `description`: Brief description of what the Skill does and when to use it (max 1024 characters)

The `description` field is critical for Claude to discover when to use your Skill. It should include both what the Skill does and when Claude should use it.

See the [best practices guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices) for complete authoring guidance including validation rules.

## Add supporting files

Create additional files alongside SKILL.md:

\```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── reference.md (optional documentation)
├── examples.md (optional examples)
├── scripts/
│   └── helper.py (optional utility)
└── templates/
    └── template.txt (optional template)
\```

Reference these files from SKILL.md:

\````markdown  theme={null}
For advanced usage, see [reference.md](reference.md).

Run the helper script:
\```bash
python scripts/helper.py input.txt
\```
\````

Claude reads these files only when needed, using progressive disclosure to manage context efficiently.

## Restrict tool access with allowed-tools

Use the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field to limit which tools Claude can use when a Skill is active:

\```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: safe-file-reader
description: Read files without making changes. Use when you need read-only file access.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Safe File Reader

This Skill provides read-only file access.

## Instructions
1. Use Read to view file contents
2. Use Grep to search within files
3. Use Glob to find files by pattern
\```

When this Skill is active, Claude can only use the specified tools (Read, Grep, Glob) without needing to ask for permission. This is useful for:

* Read-only Skills that shouldn't modify files
* Skills with limited scope: for example, only data analysis, no file writing
* Security-sensitive workflows where you want to restrict capabilities

If `allowed-tools` isn't specified, Claude will ask for permission to use tools as normal, following the standard permission model.

<Note>
  `allowed-tools` is only supported for Skills in Claude Code.
</Note>

## View available Skills

Skills are automatically discovered by Claude from three sources:

* Personal Skills: `~/.claude/skills/`
* Project Skills: `.claude/skills/`
* Plugin Skills: bundled with installed plugins

**To view all available Skills**, ask Claude directly:

\```
What Skills are available?
\```

or

\```
List all available Skills
\```

This will show all Skills from all sources, including plugin Skills.

**To inspect a specific Skill**, you can also check the filesystem:

\```bash  theme={null}
# List personal Skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/

# List project Skills (if in a project directory)
ls .claude/skills/

# View a specific Skill's content
cat ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
\```

## Test a Skill

After creating a Skill, test it by asking questions that match your description.

**Example**: If your description mentions "PDF files":

\```
Can you help me extract text from this PDF?
\```

Claude autonomously decides to use your Skill if it matches the request—you don't need to explicitly invoke it. The Skill activates automatically based on the context of your question.

## Debug a Skill

If Claude doesn't use your Skill, check these common issues:

### Make description specific

**Too vague**:

\```yaml  theme={null}
description: Helps with documents
\```

**Specific**:

\```yaml  theme={null}
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents. Use when working with PDF files or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
\```

Include both what the Skill does and when to use it in the description.

### Verify file path

**Personal Skills**: `~/.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`
**Project Skills**: `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`

Check the file exists:

\```bash  theme={null}
# Personal
ls ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Project
ls .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
\```

### Check YAML syntax

Invalid YAML prevents the Skill from loading. Verify the frontmatter:

\```bash  theme={null}
cat SKILL.md | head -n 10
\```

Ensure:

* Opening `---` on line 1
* Closing `---` before Markdown content
* Valid YAML syntax (no tabs, correct indentation)

### View errors

Run Claude Code with debug mode to see Skill loading errors:

\```bash  theme={null}
claude --debug
\```

## Share Skills with your team

**Recommended approach**: Distribute Skills through [plugins](/en/plugins).

To share Skills via plugin:

1. Create a plugin with Skills in the `skills/` directory
2. Add the plugin to a marketplace
3. Team members install the plugin

For complete instructions, see [Add Skills to your plugin](/en/plugins#add-skills-to-your-plugin).

You can also share Skills directly through project repositories:

### Step 1: Add Skill to your project

Create a project Skill:

\```bash  theme={null}
mkdir -p .claude/skills/team-skill
# Create SKILL.md
\```

### Step 2: Commit to git

\```bash  theme={null}
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "Add team Skill for PDF processing"
git push
\```

### Step 3: Team members get Skills automatically

When team members pull the latest changes, Skills are immediately available:

\```bash  theme={null}
git pull
claude  # Skills are now available
\```

## Update a Skill

Edit SKILL.md directly:

\```bash  theme={null}
# Personal Skill
code ~/.claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md

# Project Skill
code .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
\```

Changes take effect the next time you start Claude Code. If Claude Code is already running, restart it to load the updates.

## Remove a Skill

Delete the Skill directory:

\```bash  theme={null}
# Personal
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/my-skill

# Project
rm -rf .claude/skills/my-skill
git commit -m "Remove unused Skill"
\```

## Best practices

### Keep Skills focused

One Skill should address one capability:

**Focused**:

* "PDF form filling"
* "Excel data analysis"
* "Git commit messages"

**Too broad**:

* "Document processing" (split into separate Skills)
* "Data tools" (split by data type or operation)

### Write clear descriptions

Help Claude discover when to use Skills by including specific triggers in your description:

**Clear**:

\```yaml  theme={null}
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, create pivot tables, and generate charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or analyzing tabular data in .xlsx format.
\```

**Vague**:

\```yaml  theme={null}
description: For files
\```

### Test with your team

Have teammates use Skills and provide feedback:

* Does the Skill activate when expected?
* Are the instructions clear?
* Are there missing examples or edge cases?

### Document Skill versions

You can document Skill versions in your SKILL.md content to track changes over time. Add a version history section:

\```markdown  theme={null}
# My Skill

## Version History
- v2.0.0 (2025-10-01): Breaking changes to API
- v1.1.0 (2025-09-15): Added new features
- v1.0.0 (2025-09-01): Initial release
\```

This helps team members understand what changed between versions.

## Troubleshooting

### Claude doesn't use my Skill

**Symptom**: You ask a relevant question but Claude doesn't use your Skill.

**Check**: Is the description specific enough?

Vague descriptions make discovery difficult. Include both what the Skill does and when to use it, with key terms users would mention.

**Too generic**:

\```yaml  theme={null}
description: Helps with data
\```

**Specific**:

\```yaml  theme={null}
description: Analyze Excel spreadsheets, generate pivot tables, create charts. Use when working with Excel files, spreadsheets, or .xlsx files.
\```

**Check**: Is the YAML valid?

Run validation to check for syntax errors:

\```bash  theme={null}
# View frontmatter
cat .claude/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md | head -n 15

# Check for common issues
# - Missing opening or closing ---
# - Tabs instead of spaces
# - Unquoted strings with special characters
\```

**Check**: Is the Skill in the correct location?

\```bash  theme={null}
# Personal Skills
ls ~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md

# Project Skills
ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
\```

### Skill has errors

**Symptom**: The Skill loads but doesn't work correctly.

**Check**: Are dependencies available?

Claude will automatically install required dependencies (or ask for permission to install them) when it needs them.

**Check**: Do scripts have execute permissions?

\```bash  theme={null}
chmod +x .claude/skills/my-skill/scripts/*.py
\```

**Check**: Are file paths correct?

Use forward slashes (Unix style) in all paths:

**Correct**: `scripts/helper.py`
**Wrong**: `scripts\helper.py` (Windows style)

### Multiple Skills conflict

**Symptom**: Claude uses the wrong Skill or seems confused between similar Skills.

**Be specific in descriptions**: Help Claude choose the right Skill by using distinct trigger terms in your descriptions.

Instead of:

\```yaml  theme={null}
# Skill 1
description: For data analysis

# Skill 2
description: For analyzing data
\```

Use:

\```yaml  theme={null}
# Skill 1
description: Analyze sales data in Excel files and CRM exports. Use for sales reports, pipeline analysis, and revenue tracking.

# Skill 2
description: Analyze log files and system metrics data. Use for performance monitoring, debugging, and system diagnostics.
\```

## Examples

### Simple Skill (single file)

\```
commit-helper/
└── SKILL.md
\```

\```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: generating-commit-messages
description: Generates clear commit messages from git diffs. Use when writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
---

# Generating Commit Messages

## Instructions

1. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
2. I'll suggest a commit message with:
   - Summary under 50 characters
   - Detailed description
   - Affected components

## Best practices

- Use present tense
- Explain what and why, not how
\```

### Skill with tool permissions

\```
code-reviewer/
└── SKILL.md
\```

\```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code for best practices and potential issues. Use when reviewing code, checking PRs, or analyzing code quality.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Code Reviewer

## Review checklist

1. Code organization and structure
2. Error handling
3. Performance considerations
4. Security concerns
5. Test coverage

## Instructions

1. Read the target files using Read tool
2. Search for patterns using Grep
3. Find related files using Glob
4. Provide detailed feedback on code quality
\```

### Multi-file Skill

\```
pdf-processing/
├── SKILL.md
├── FORMS.md
├── REFERENCE.md
└── scripts/
    ├── fill_form.py
    └── validate.py
\```

**SKILL.md**:

\````yaml  theme={null}
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Use when working with PDF files, forms, or document extraction. Requires pypdf and pdfplumber packages.
---

# PDF Processing

## Quick start

Extract text:
\```python
import pdfplumber
with pdfplumber.open("doc.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
\```

For form filling, see [FORMS.md](FORMS.md).
For detailed API reference, see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).

## Requirements

Packages must be installed in your environment:
\```bash
pip install pypdf pdfplumber
\```
\````

<Note>
  List required packages in the description. Packages must be installed in your environment before Claude can use them.
</Note>

Claude loads additional files only when needed.

_**Agent (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) (sidechain)**_

Perfect! Based on the official Claude Code documentation, here's a comprehensive guide for creating your CV Data Ingestion & Organization Skill.

## 1. File Format and Location

Claude Code Skills are stored as **directories** containing a `SKILL.md` file:

**Project Skills** (shared with team via git):
```
/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/.claude/skills/cv-data-ingestion/
├── SKILL.md (required)
├── TEMPLATES.md (optional)
├── reference.md (optional)
└── scripts/
    └── organize-career-data.py (optional utility)
```

**Personal Skills** (for your individual use):
```
~/.claude/skills/cv-data-ingestion/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/ (optional)
```

Since this is for your portfolio project, I recommend using **Project Skills** to share with team members.

## 2. Skill Schema and Structure

A `SKILL.md` file requires YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content:

```yaml
---
name: cv-data-ingestion
description: [Brief description of what the Skill does and WHEN to use it]
allowed-tools: [Optional: limit tool access]
---

# Skill Title

## Instructions
Step-by-step guidance for Claude

## Examples
Concrete usage examples
```

**Frontmatter Fields**:

| Field | Required | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `name` | Yes | Lowercase, hyphens/numbers only, max 64 characters |
| `description` | Yes | What it does + when to use it, max 1024 characters. This is critical for Claude to discover your Skill |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Comma-separated tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, etc.). Restricts Claude's capabilities when Skill is active |

## 3. Best Practices for Skill Prompts

**Description is critical for discovery.** Include:
- **What the Skill does** (specific capabilities)
- **When to use it** (trigger phrases users might mention)
- **Key terms** (file types, formats, terminology)

**Example descriptions**:

Good (too vague):
```yaml
description: Helps with career data
```

Better (specific triggers):
```yaml
description: Ingest and organize raw career data from Obsidian notes, CSV files, and markdown documents into structured portfolio content. Use when processing career history, work experience, project information, or CV data from multiple sources.
```

**Instructions should be**:
- Step-by-step and clear
- Include specific file formats supported
- Mention any required dependencies
- Provide examples with concrete data

## 4. Parameter Handling in Skills

Skills don't have explicit parameter definitions like functions. Instead, Claude infers parameters from context. You can enable parameter handling through:

**A. User-provided context** (implicit):
Claude reads the user's request and identifies what data/files to process.

**B. Optional: Slash commands for explicit parameters** (separate from Skills):
If you need explicit parameters, combine a Skill with a custom slash command. However, for data ingestion, implicit context usually works better.

**C. Supporting files for templates and schemas**:
Create reference documents that Claude reads when needed.

**Example approach**:
```markdown
## Expected Input Formats

### Obsidian Notes
- Structure: Title (H1), metadata block, content
- Supports dataview syntax for job titles, dates, skills

### CSV Files
- Required columns: name, title, company, start_date, end_date, description
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD

### Markdown Files
- Any markdown file with career data
- Will extract headings, tables, and body text
```

## 5. Complete Skill File Example

Create this file at: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/.claude/skills/cv-data-ingestion/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: cv-data-ingestion
description: Ingest and organize raw career data from Obsidian notes, CSV files, and markdown documents into structured portfolio content. Use when processing career history, work experience, project information, or CV data from multiple sources.
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
---

# CV Data Ingestion & Organization

Transforms unstructured career data into organized portfolio content with consistent structure and metadata.

## Supported Input Formats

### Obsidian Notes (.md files)
- Single or bulk Obsidian vault exports
- Supports YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Preserves tags, links, and structured sections

### CSV Files (.csv)
- Standard comma-separated values
- Required columns: `title`, `company`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `description`
- Optional columns: `skills`, `achievements`, `technologies`, `location`

### Markdown Documents (.md)
- Any markdown file containing career data
- Supports tables, lists, and structured sections
- Extracts headings, content, and metadata

### JSON Files (.json)
- Structured career data in JSON format
- Supports nested objects for projects and skills

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Input Source
Determine the format and location of raw career data:
- Is it Obsidian markdown files?
- Is it a CSV export?
- Is it scattered across multiple markdown files?
- Is it structured JSON?

### Step 2: Read and Parse Data
For each source type, use appropriate reading strategies:

**For Obsidian/Markdown files:**
```bash
# Find all relevant files
find . -name "*.md" -type f | grep -E "(career|experience|work|project)"

# Read individual files to assess structure
```

**For CSV files:**
```bash
# Verify structure by reading first few rows
head -20 data.csv
```

**For JSON:**
```bash
# Pretty print to understand structure
cat data.json | jq .
```

### Step 3: Normalize and Organize
Map raw data into a consistent schema:

```json
{
  "type": "experience|project|skill|education",
  "title": "Job Title or Project Name",
  "organization": "Company or Organization",
  "dates": {
    "start": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end": "YYYY-MM-DD"
  },
  "description": "Full description of role, achievements, or project",
  "technologies": ["tech1", "tech2"],
  "achievements": ["achievement1", "achievement2"],
  "metadata": {
    "source": "original filename",
    "originalFormat": "csv|markdown|json"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Create Structured Output
Generate organized portfolio content files:

- **experiences.json**: Career roles and positions
- **projects.json**: Notable projects and case studies
- **skills.json**: Technical and soft skills with proficiency levels
- **education.json**: Degrees, certifications, training

Each file should follow the schema above for consistency.

### Step 5: Validate and Consolidate
- Check for duplicates across sources
- Fill missing dates or descriptions
- Ensure consistent date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Verify all required fields are populated
- Create a summary report of ingested data

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Import from Obsidian
1. Locate the Obsidian vault or markdown export
2. Identify files containing career data (look for keywords like "experience", "projects", "skills")
3. Read each file and extract structured data
4. Map to the normalized schema
5. Consolidate into output JSON files

### Workflow 2: Merge Multiple CSV Sources
1. Find all CSV files in the project
2. Read CSV headers to understand structure
3. Identify common fields across files
4. Normalize column names to standard schema
5. Merge and deduplicate
6. Export as consolidated JSON

### Workflow 3: Extract from Mixed Sources
1. Scan for all data files (*.md, *.csv, *.json)
2. Group by type
3. Process each type using appropriate parser
4. Consolidate into unified structure
5. Generate organized output files

## Examples

### Example 1: Ingest Obsidian Experience Notes
User request: "I have Obsidian notes in my vault about my past jobs. Can you organize them into a structured format?"

**Process:**
1. Find markdown files in Obsidian vault
2. Read files looking for headers like "## Work Experience", "### Role at Company"
3. Extract: title, company, duration, key achievements
4. Map to normalized schema
5. Generate experiences.json with all roles chronologically organized

### Example 2: Convert CSV to Structured Data
User request: "I exported my LinkedIn profile as CSV. Can you organize the experience section?"

**Process:**
1. Read CSV file and examine headers
2. Parse rows and extract relevant fields
3. Convert date strings to YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Add descriptions from CSV content
5. Output structured experience and skills JSON

### Example 3: Consolidate Mixed Career Data
User request: "I have career data scattered in markdown, CSV, and JSON files. Can you organize everything?"

**Process:**
1. Glob for all *.md, *.csv, *.json files
2. Process each format
3. Identify duplicates (same company/title/date)
4. Merge into single consolidated structure
5. Generate summary report of what was ingested

## Output Structure

The Skill generates an organized directory structure:

```
portfolio-data/
├── experiences.json        # Career roles and positions
├── projects.json           # Notable projects
├── skills.json             # Technical and soft skills
├── education.json          # Education and certifications
├── ingestion_report.md     # Summary of what was processed
└── raw_archives/           # Original files for reference
    ├── obsidian_notes/
    ├── csv_exports/
    └── markdown_docs/
```

Each JSON file follows the normalized schema for easy integration into your portfolio system.

## Tips

- **File naming**: Keep original filenames when archiving for reference
- **Date consistency**: Always normalize to YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Deduplication**: Check for same roles/projects from multiple sources
- **Metadata**: Preserve information about data source and transformation
- **Validation**: Verify no required fields are missing before completing
- **Incremental processing**: Can add new data sources and merge incrementally

## Dependencies

No external packages required. Uses Claude's built-in file reading and bash tools.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Dates in different formats
**Solution**: Parse and normalize all dates to YYYY-MM-DD. Check for month-first vs day-first conventions.

**Issue**: Duplicate entries from multiple sources
**Solution**: Create a deduplication script that matches on company, title, and date range.

**Issue**: Missing descriptions
**Solution**: Extract from longer narrative fields or ask user for clarification on key achievements.

**Issue**: Inconsistent field names across sources
**Solution**: Create a mapping table showing how source fields map to normalized schema.
```

## Creating Your Skill

Run these commands to set up your Skill:

```bash
# Create the Skill directory

## How Claude Will Use This Skill

Claude will **automatically** invoke this Skill when:
- You ask about ingesting or organizing career data
- You mention CSV, Obsidian, markdown, or JSON files with career information
- You request structured portfolio content from raw data

You don't need to explicitly call the Skill—it's model-invoked based on your request matching the description and keywords.

## Testing Your Skill

Try asking Claude:
```
"I have an Obsidian vault with my past work experience. Can you organize it into a structured portfolio format?"

"I exported my LinkedIn as CSV. Can you convert it to organized JSON with my experiences and skills?"

"I have career data scattered in multiple markdown and CSV files. Can you consolidate everything?"
```

## Next Steps

1. Create the `.claude/skills/cv-data-ingestion/` directory
2. Add the SKILL.md file with the content above
3. Optionally add supporting files (TEMPLATES.md, reference documents)
4. Commit to git: `git add .claude/skills/` and `git commit -m "Add CV data ingestion skill"`
5. Test by asking Claude about ingesting career data
6. Iterate based on how Claude uses the Skill
