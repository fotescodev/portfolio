Warmup

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) (sidechain)**_

I'll perform a quick warmup by exploring the codebase structure to understand what we're working with.

```bash
ls -la /Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio
```

```bash
find /Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio -type f -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.json" | head -30
```

```bash
cat /Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/package.json
```

Based on my exploration, this is a **Next.js 14 portfolio application** with the following key characteristics:

## Project Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.29 with React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations
- **Database**: Prisma ORM (likely PostgreSQL)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives, Lucide icons
- **Features**: MDX support for blog content, Framer Motion animations

## Key Dependencies
- `next-mdx-remote` - For rendering MDX content
- `@prisma/client` - Database ORM
- `framer-motion` - Animations
- `react-hook-form` with `zod` - Form handling and validation
- Various Radix UI components for accessible UI elements

## Project Structure Observations
- Standard Next.js App Router structure
- Uses Turbopack for development (`next dev --turbopack`)
- Has Prisma for data persistence
- Claude integration (`.claude/` directory present)

The codebase appears to be a professional portfolio site with blog functionality, likely featuring projects showcase, contact forms, and content management through MDX.

**Warmup complete.** I'm ready to explore specific requirements or design implementation plans. What would you like me to investigate?
