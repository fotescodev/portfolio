Warmup

I understand this is a warmup message. I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for your portfolio project.

I can see from the environment that:
- Working directory: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio`
- Current branch: `content-feat`
- Main branch: `main`
- There are some uncommitted changes to `.claude/settings.local.json` and an untracked `test_output.txt` file

When you're ready to provide requirements for a planning task, I'll:
1. Explore the codebase thoroughly using read-only operations
2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
3. Design a solution with step-by-step implementation strategy
4. Identify critical files for implementation

What would you like me to plan?
