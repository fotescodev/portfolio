_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Let me invoke your writing style skill to make sure I nail your voice:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I have the writing style context. Let me look at the bio and reframe it to be punchier while keeping Dmitrii's voice. The current bio is:

1. "Most recently, at Anchorage Digital, I was leading the integration of large protocols into institutional custody and staking, such as Aztec, Plume (RWAs) and Succinct. Prior to that, I helped build Dapper Labs'(Flow) suite of developer tools, and Ankr's Web3 infrastructure product such as Advanced APIs and SDKs."

2. "I started my journey into Web3 in 2017 at Microsoft. As a full stack engineer back then, I've shipped Solidity smart contracts and built one of the first Web3 project - Xbox Game Store Royalties Tracking. Eight years in, I'm still drawn to the same kind of problems: democratizing infrastructure that has to work every time, for builders who can't afford it not to."

3. "Currently exploring how AI capabilities integrate into existing business flows, especially where Web3 meets AI."

The tagline: "Eight years building - from enterprise blockchain at Microsoft to Web3 developer tools to institutional custody."

Issues I see:
- First paragraph is a bit listy and passive ("I was leading")
- "I started my journey" is a bit cliché
- "Currently exploring" is weak
- The tagline is fine but could be punchier

Let me reframe this to be:
- More direct and action-oriented
- Active voice
- Punchier sentences
- Less "journey" language, more substance
- Keep the warmth but tighten it up

Here's my take:
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Got it. Here's a punchier reframe that keeps your voice:

---

**Tagline:**
```
Eight years shipping infrastructure that has to work every time.
```

**Bio (3 paragraphs):**

```yaml
bio:
  - >
    At Anchorage Digital, I shipped integrations for protocols like Aztec, Plume, 
    and Succinct—bringing cutting-edge tech into institutional custody and staking. 
    Before that, I built developer tools at Dapper Labs (Flow) and Web3 infrastructure 
    at Ankr: Advanced APIs, SDKs, the picks and shovels builders actually need.
  - >
    I've been in Web3 since 2017, when I was writing Solidity at Microsoft and 
    shipped one of its first blockchain projects—Xbox Game Store Royalties Tracking. 
    Eight years later, I'm still cracking the same kind of problems: democratizing 
    infrastructure for builders who can't afford it to fail.
  - >
    Now I'm digging into how AI agents fit into real business workflows—especially 
    where Web3 and AI collide.
```

---

**What changed:**
- Killed passive voice ("I was leading" → "I shipped")
- Dropped "journey" language
- Added "picks and shovels" metaphor for flavor
- "Currently exploring" → "Now I'm digging into" (more active)
- "can't afford it not to" → "can't afford it to fail" (cleaner)
- Used "cracking" per your vocabulary preferences

Want me to apply this edit to the file?

cracking is not something I would say - I would write "stimulated or challenged by"

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to replace "cracking" with "stimulated or challenged by" - let me adjust the bio accordingly. That phrase is more authentic to how they actually speak.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Good call. Here's the revised version:

```yaml
bio:
  - >
    At Anchorage Digital, I shipped integrations for protocols like Aztec, Plume, 
    and Succinct—bringing cutting-edge tech into institutional custody and staking. 
    Before that, I built developer tools at Dapper Labs (Flow) and Web3 infrastructure 
    at Ankr: Advanced APIs, SDKs, the picks and shovels builders actually need.
  - >
    I've been in Web3 since 2017, when I was writing Solidity at Microsoft and 
    shipped one of its first blockchain projects—Xbox Game Store Royalties Tracking. 
    Eight years later, I'm still challenged by the same kind of problems: democratizing 
    infrastructure for builders who can't afford it to fail.
  - >
    Now I'm digging into how AI agents fit into real business workflows—especially 
    where Web3 and AI collide.
```

_**User**_

also add a thought on AI - my thesis is that this is Web3's prime moment to shine - blockchain technology is uniquely position to become the defact transaction layer for the agentic economy that is about to explode. Stablecoin rails, Agentic identity attestation, and Agent to Agent value transfer is what keeps me at night.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to add a stronger AI thesis to the bio. They're saying blockchain is positioned to be the transaction layer for the agentic economy - stablecoins, identity attestation, and A2A value transfer. Let me weave this into the third paragraph to make it punchier and more specific.

"keeps me at night" - I think they mean "keeps me up at night" or "what I think about at night". Let me incorporate this naturally.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Love it. That's a real thesis, not just "exploring AI." Here's the updated third paragraph:

```yaml
bio:
  - >
    At Anchorage Digital, I shipped integrations for protocols like Aztec, Plume, 
    and Succinct—bringing cutting-edge tech into institutional custody and staking. 
    Before that, I built developer tools at Dapper Labs (Flow) and Web3 infrastructure 
    at Ankr: Advanced APIs, SDKs, the picks and shovels builders actually need.
  - >
    I've been in Web3 since 2017, when I was writing Solidity at Microsoft and 
    shipped one of its first blockchain projects—Xbox Game Store Royalties Tracking. 
    Eight years later, I'm still challenged by the same kind of problems: democratizing 
    infrastructure for builders who can't afford it to fail.
  - >
    This is Web3's moment. Blockchain is uniquely positioned to become the default 
    transaction layer for the agentic economy that's about to explode. Stablecoin rails, 
    agentic identity attestation, agent-to-agent value transfer—that's what keeps me up at night.
```

Punchy, opinionated, and says something. Want me to apply the full edit?

The user wants a shorter CTA (call to action) line to add after the bio. Something like "if you're excited about the same challenges, let's talk" but punchier.

Let me think of some options:
- "Building in this space? Let's talk."
- "If this resonates, reach out."
- "Excited about the same problems? Let's connect."
- "Working on similar challenges? I'd love to hear from you."

Going for punchy and direct per their style.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Done. Ends with a clear ask now.

---

_**User**_

This is Web3's moment. - can we make this in italics and same color as the word Trust in the hero?

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to style "This is Web3's moment." similar to how "trust" is styled in the hero section. Looking at the hero section, I can see it uses a style system:

```yaml
hero:
  headline:
    - text: "Building"
      style: "italic"
    - text: "at the edge of"
      style: "muted"
    - text: "trust"
      style: "accent"
```

So "trust" has `style: "accent"`. The user wants "This is Web3's moment." to be italic AND accent colored.

But the bio section is just plain text in YAML strings right now - it doesn't have the same styling system as the headline. The bio is just a list of paragraph strings.

I need to understand how this is rendered. Either:
1. The frontend already supports some kind of markdown/styling in the bio text
2. We need to change the data structure to support styled segments like the headline does
3. We need to add some markup that the frontend can parse

Let me check if there's a way to do this. The simplest approach would be to use markdown syntax if the frontend supports it (like *italics* or **bold**). But for the accent color, that's not standard markdown.

I should ask the user how the frontend handles styling, or look at how the site renders this. But since this is a quick task, I should probably just ask them what approach they want - do they want me to:
1. Use markdown for italics and see if we need to add accent styling in the frontend?
2. Change the bio structure to support styled segments like the headline?

Actually, let me just ask them since this is a frontend/rendering question.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

The bio is currently plain text strings. The hero headline uses a structured format with `style: "accent"` for that effect.

Two options:

1. **Add markup in the text** (if your frontend parses it) — like `*This is Web3's moment.*` for italics, plus a custom marker for accent
2. **Restructure the bio** to support styled segments like the headline does

How does your frontend render the bio? Does it support markdown or do we need to add styled segment support?

---

_**User**_

what is simpler? 

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking what's simpler. Option 1 (markup in text) is simpler because it doesn't require restructuring the data. We can add markdown-style markers and then handle them in the frontend.

The simplest approach would be to wrap "This is Web3's moment." in some marker like `*...*` for italics or a custom syntax like `{{accent}}...{{/accent}}` that the frontend can parse.

But I should check how their frontend currently renders the bio to see if it already supports any markdown parsing. Let me suggest the simplest path forward.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Option 1 is simpler. Add a marker in the text, then update the frontend component to parse it.

Something like:

```yaml
- >
  {{accent}}This is Web3's moment.{{/accent}} Blockchain is uniquely positioned...
```

Then a small tweak to the component that renders the bio to replace `{{accent}}...{{/accent}}` with a styled span.

Want me to check how your About section renders and add the support?

I found the key rendering code at lines 307-316:

```jsx
{about.bio.map((paragraph, index) => (
  <p key={index} style={{
    fontSize: '15px',
    lineHeight: 1.75,

  }}>
    {paragraph}
  </p>
))}
```

It's just rendering the paragraph as plain text. To support styled segments, I need to:
1. Add a helper function that parses the text for `{{accent}}...{{/accent}}` markers
2. Replace those with styled spans

Let me also check what the accent color is. The user mentioned "same color as the word Trust in the hero". Let me check the hero section to see what accent styling looks like.

Found it. The accent style uses `color: 'var(--color-accent)'` and also `fontStyle: 'italic'` is used in the hero.

So for the bio, I need to:
1. Create a helper function to parse `{{accent}}...{{/accent}}` markers
2. Render those parts with `color: var(--color-accent)` and `fontStyle: italic`

Let me update the AboutSection.tsx to support this. I'll add a helper function and update the bio rendering.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Got it. The accent style is `color: var(--color-accent)` with italic. I'll add a parser to the AboutSection:

_**User**_

it works, but can you make it also bold and the same style font as the tagline?

---

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants the accent text to also be bold and use the same font as the tagline. Let me check the tagline styling to see what font it uses.

Looking at the AboutSection.tsx, the tagline is styled at lines 292-302:
```jsx
<h2 style={{
  fontSize: isMobile ? '28px' : isTablet ? '32px' : '40px',
  fontFamily: 'var(--font-serif)',
  fontStyle: 'italic',
  lineHeight: 1.3,
  color: 'var(--color-text-primary)',
  marginBottom: '28px',
  letterSpacing: '-0.02em'
}}>
  {about.tagline}
</h2>
```

So the tagline uses:
- `fontFamily: 'var(--font-serif)'`
- `fontStyle: 'italic'`

I need to update the parseStyledText function to also add:
- `fontFamily: 'var(--font-serif)'`
- `fontWeight: 'bold'` or a specific weight

Let me update the styling.

   bio:
     - >
-      Most recently I was at Anchorage Digital, shipping staking infrastructure
-      for institutional clients—the kind where a slashing event means losing
-      the account. Before that I built wallet SDKs at Forte, developer tooling
-      at Dapper, and API infrastructure at Ankr.
+      At Anchorage Digital, I shipped integrations for protocols like Aztec, Plume,
+      and Succinct—bringing cutting-edge tech into institutional custody and staking.
+      Before that, I built developer tools at Dapper Labs—Flow Playground, Flow CLI—and
+      Web3 infrastructure at Ankr: Advanced APIs, SDKs, the picks and shovels builders
+      actually need.
     - >
-      I started at Microsoft building Xbox royalties on Ethereum—before 'Web3'
-      was a term. Eight years in, I'm still drawn to the same kind of problems:
-      infrastructure that has to work every time, for people who can't afford
-      it not to.
+      I've been in Web3 since 2017, when I was writing Solidity at Microsoft and
+      shipped one of its first blockchain projects—Xbox Game Store Royalties Tracking.
+      Eight years later, I'm still challenged by the same kind of problems: democratizing
+      infrastructure for builders who can't afford it to fail.
     - >
-      I care about developer experience—helping builders ship fast without
-      fighting their tools. Currently exploring how AI capabilities integrate

I see the changes. For the commit, I should only include the profile.yaml and AboutSection.tsx changes - those are the ones we worked on. The .claude/settings.local.json and .claude/skills/reorient/SKILL.md changes seem unrelated to our bio work.

I see the case studies:
1. `01-eth-staking.md` - user wants to DELETE this
2. `02-mempools.md` - user wants to move to TOP
3. `03-ankr-rpc.md`
4. `04-xbox-royalties.md`

To delete ETH Staking and move Mempools to top, I need to:
1. Delete `01-eth-staking.md`
2. Rename `02-mempools.md` to `01-mempools.md` and change its `id` to 1 inside the file
3. Rename `03-ankr-rpc.md` to `02-ankr-rpc.md` and update the id
4. Rename `04-xbox-royalties.md` to `03-xbox-royalties.md` and update the id

Let me first check the frontmatter of each file to see the ID structure, then do the edits.

    36→---
    37→
    38→Liquidations, governance votes, whale movements—every major on-chain event was invisible until it was too late. Traders missed opportunities. Protocols couldn't react fast enough. Communities were always behind.
    39→
    40→## The Challenge
    41→
    42→Blockchains are transparent, but staying ahead of critical events required complex custom setups, constant polling, or expensive infrastructure. No simple way to get real-time notifications about what's happening on-chain.
    43→
    44→The constraints:
    45→- Bootstrapping solo with limited resources
    46→- Multiple chains needed (Ethereum, Cosmos ecosystem)
    47→- Sub-second latency or it's worthless—alerts after the fact are just news
    48→- Developer SDK simple enough for quick integration
    49→
    50→## The Approach
    51→
    52→The bet: a scenario-based alerting platform with no-code configuration. Make tracking whale wallets as easy as setting up a Google Alert.
    53→
    54→### Alternatives Considered
    55→
    56→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    57→|--------|------------|---------|
    58→| Build for enterprise only | Higher contract values, clearer monetization | Long sales cycles, needed traction fast |
    59→| Developer-only API | Simpler product, focused use case | Missed larger opportunity in no-code market |
    60→| Single chain focus | Faster development, deeper integration | Multi-chain was the clear direction of the ecosystem |
    61→
    62→We built both: no-code consumer platform AND developer SDK. Started with Cosmos where competition was thinner.
    63→
    64→## Key Decision
    65→
    66→**Launching as default alerting provider on Archway mainnet**
    67→
    68→Archway (Cosmos SDK L1) was launching their mainnet. I pitched Mempools as their official alerting infrastructure.
    69→
    70→Launched Archway-Alerts.com the same day as their mainnet. Became the default platform for the ecosystem.
    71→
    72→> Instead of competing for developers, we became the recommended solution. One partnership gave us instant distribution and credibility.
    73→
    74→## Execution
    75→
    76→### Phase 1: Core Platform (8 weeks)
    77→- Real-time event monitoring infrastructure on Ethereum
    78→- Scenario builder with AND/OR logic for complex alerts
    79→- Multi-channel delivery: Telegram, Discord, webhooks, email
    80→
    81→### Phase 2: SDK Development (4 weeks)
    82→- Published mempools-sdk to NPM
    83→- Documentation and quickstart guides
    84→- Embeddable UI templates for white-label deployments
    85→
    86→### Phase 3: Cosmos Expansion (4 weeks)
    87→- Extended to Archway, Juno, and Canto networks
    88→- Chain-specific event parsing for Cosmos transaction types
    89→- Archway-Alerts.com as flagship deployment
    90→
    91→### Phase 4: Partnerships (Ongoing)
    92→- Luganodes partnership for enhanced node infrastructure
    93→- Ecosystem projects onboarded as early adopters
    94→- Community building through Twitter Spaces and Discord
    95→
    96→## Results
    97→
    98→- **200+ Daily Active Users** — Organic growth through ecosystem partnerships
    99→- **Sub-second delivery** — Alerts arriving before users could manually check
   100→- **5 chains supported** — Ethereum, Arbitrum, Archway, Juno, Canto
   101→- **Default Archway provider** — Launched alongside mainnet as official platform
   102→
   103→The platform enabled use cases that weren't possible before: arbitrage bots reacting to on-chain signals, portfolio trackers with instant notifications, governance watchers alerting communities to votes.
   104→
   105→## What I Learned
   106→
   107→**What worked:**
   108→- Ecosystem partnerships over raw marketing—one protocol deal worth 100 Twitter impressions
   109→- No-code interface expanded addressable market beyond developers
   110→- Multi-channel delivery (Telegram/Discord) was table stakes for Web3
   111→- Launching with a chain's mainnet = instant distribution
   112→
   113→**What didn't:**
   114→- Underestimated infrastructure costs for real-time monitoring at scale
   115→- Built too many features initially—should have shipped MVP faster
   116→- Discord community building was slower ROI than direct partnership outreach
   117→- Cross-chain complexity higher than anticipated (each chain has different event formats)
   118→
   119→> First-time founder lesson: distribution beats product. Having Archway recommend us to their ecosystem was more valuable than any feature we could have built.
   120→
   121→If I did it again: even more aggressive on ecosystem partnerships from day 1. In crypto infrastructure, you win through distribution, not features.

    48→No product-market fit meant the RPC product would get shut down or sold off. Team jobs were on the line.
    49→
    50→## The Challenge
    51→
    52→Ankr's RPC infrastructure was underutilized and treated as a commodity. Competing on price with Infura and Alchemy in the developer segment was a race to the bottom. Needed differentiation and a sustainable business model.
    53→
    54→The constraints:
    55→- 5 engineers total
    56→- Infura and Alchemy owned developer mindshare
    57→- RPC is inherently commoditized—hard to differentiate on features
    58→- Developer segment has high churn and low willingness to pay
    59→
    60→## The Approach
    61→
    62→The bet: blockchain protocols have different needs than individual developers. They need reliable infrastructure for their entire ecosystems, have longer sales cycles but higher LTV, and will pay premium for partnership-level support.
    63→
    64→### Alternatives Considered
    65→
    66→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    67→|--------|------------|---------|
    68→| Double down on developer DX | Large market, existing user base | Couldn't out-Alchemy Alchemy—they had 10x our resources |
    69→| Pivot to enterprise (non-crypto) | Higher contract values | Sales cycle too long for our runway |
    70→| Build specialized APIs | Higher margins, less commoditized | Good complement but not standalone business |
    71→
    72→We pivoted to B2B protocol sales while building Advanced APIs as differentiation. Protocols became our core customer; developers became their users.
    73→
    74→## Key Decision
    75→
    76→**B2B pivot: protocols over developers**
    77→
    78→Team was attached to developer-first identity. Pivot felt like abandoning our roots.
    79→
    80→Shifted primary customer from developers to protocols. Developers became users we served through protocol partnerships.
    81→
    82→> Protocols had 10x LTV of developer accounts. One protocol deal = 100 developer signups in revenue. Unit economics finally worked.
    83→
    84→## Execution
    85→
    86→### Phase 1: Customer Discovery (4 weeks)
    87→- 15+ interviews with blockchain protocol teams about infrastructure pain points
    88→- Key insight: protocols were stitching together multiple providers
    89→- Mapped competitive landscape and pricing for protocol-tier contracts
    90→
    91→### Phase 2: Product Repositioning (3 weeks)
    92→- Pricing redesigned with protocol-tier and SLA guarantees
    93→- Partnership program with dedicated support channels
    94→- Case studies from early protocol conversations
    95→
    96→### Phase 3: Advanced APIs Development (8 weeks)
    97→- Shipped Ankr Advanced APIs (NFT, token, query APIs)
    98→- Ankr.JS SDK for improved developer experience
    99→- Usage analytics dashboard for protocol partners
   100→
   101→### Phase 4: Go-to-Market (Ongoing)
   102→- Outbound sales targeting protocol BD teams
   103→- Content marketing around protocol infrastructure needs
   104→- Referral program where protocols recommended us to their developers
   105→
   106→## Results
   107→
   108→- **15× revenue growth** — From ~$130K to $2M ARR in 8 months
   109→- **$2M ARR in 6 months** — Target that seemed impossible at start
   110→- **1M+ daily API requests** — Usage scaled with protocol partnerships
   111→
   112→Proved B2B model works for infrastructure products. Ankr raised additional funding citing this traction. Team avoided layoffs that hit other crypto companies.
   113→
   114→## What I Learned
   115→
   116→**What worked:**
   117→- Customer interviews revealed insight competitors missed—protocols were underserved
   118→- Protocol partnerships created network effects (their developers became our users)
   119→- Advanced APIs gave us differentiation beyond commodity RPC
   120→- SLA guarantees justified premium pricing developers wouldn't pay
   121→
   122→**What didn't:**
   123→- Priced protocol tier too low initially. Left money on the table with first 3 deals
   124→- Ankr.JS SDK was over-engineered. Developers wanted simple examples, not comprehensive abstraction
   125→- Spent too much time on marketing content that didn't convert. Direct outreach was 10x more effective
   126→
   127→> In infrastructure, your customer isn't always your user. Finding the right customer segment can transform unit economics overnight.
   128→
   129→If I did it again: start outbound sales 4 weeks earlier. We waited for "perfect" product when good-enough product with strong sales motion would have accelerated revenue.

    34→
    35→Royalty disputes with major publishers were costing millions in legal fees and damaging relationships. The $120B gaming industry needed a transparent system that could eliminate disputes and give publishers real-time visibility into their earnings.
    36→
    37→## The Challenge
    38→
    39→Xbox needed a transparent, auditable system for tracking and distributing royalty payments to game publishers. Existing databases couldn't give publishers the auditability they demanded—and disputes over payment accuracy were getting expensive.
    40→
    41→The constraints:
    42→- Xbox-scale transaction volumes (millions of purchases)
    43→- Publishers need real-time visibility into royalty accruals
    44→- Audit trail must be immutable and independently verifiable
    45→- Transaction data can't be exposed to competitors
    46→
    47→## The Approach
    48→
    49→The bet: blockchain gives publishers the immutability and transparency they need, while smart contracts automate complex royalty calculations that were error-prone when done manually.
    50→
    51→### Alternatives Considered
    52→
    53→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    54→|--------|------------|---------|
    55→| Enhanced database with audit logging | Simpler, existing infrastructure | Publishers didn't trust Microsoft-controlled audit logs |
    56→| Public Ethereum mainnet | Maximum transparency, decentralization | Transaction data couldn't be public—competitor intelligence risk. Gas costs prohibitive |
    57→| Hyperledger | Enterprise-ready, permissioned by design | Wanted Ethereum ecosystem for tooling and talent |
    58→
    59→We went with a private Ethereum consortium—permissioned access, Ethereum compatibility for tooling, transaction privacy preserved.
    60→
    61→## Key Decision
    62→
    63→**Private consortium vs. public Ethereum**
    64→
    65→Some stakeholders pushed for public chain for "true decentralization." Publishers were concerned about data exposure.
    66→
    67→Chose private consortium. Gave publishers what they actually needed (independent verification) without exposing competitive data.
    68→
    69→> This pattern became the template for other Microsoft blockchain projects.
    70→
    71→## Execution
    72→
    73→### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (3 months)
    74→- Initial smart contract for basic royalty calculation logic
    75→- Demonstrated to Xbox leadership that blockchain could handle required throughput
    76→- Identified key technical risks: key management, network consensus, data privacy
    77→
    78→### Phase 2: Infrastructure Build (6 months)
    79→- Docker/Kubernetes architecture for blockchain consortium nodes
    80→- Deployment automation for multi-node Ethereum network on Azure
    81→- Key management system integrated with Azure Key Vault
    82→
    83→### Phase 3: Smart Contract Development (4 months)
    84→- Solidity contracts for royalty tracking and distribution
    85→- Comprehensive testing framework for smart contract validation
    86→- Publisher onboarding flow with role-based access control
    87→
    88→### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (6 months)
    89→- Integrated with Xbox store transaction pipeline
    90→- Parallel processing with existing system for validation
    91→- Security audit with external blockchain specialists
    92→
    93→## Results
    94→
    95→- **99% faster processing** — Royalty calculation from weeks to near real-time
    96→- **45 days → 4 minutes** — Publishers went from waiting 45 days for royalty data to accessing it in under 4 minutes
    97→- **40%+ operational effort reduction** — Automated system eliminated manual reconciliation
    98→- **Zero disputed payments post-launch** — Transparent, immutable audit trail eliminated disputes
    99→
   100→The system processes royalty payments for Microsoft's gaming ecosystem serving **2.7B+ consumers worldwide**. EY and Microsoft published this as a reference case study for enterprise blockchain adoption.
   101→
   102→> "By implementing a blockchain-based network and streamlined royalty processing, game publishers and Xbox benefit from a more trusted, transparent and connected system from contract creation through to royalty settlements." — Luke Fewel, General Manager, Global Finance Operations, Microsoft
   103→
   104→**Ubisoft** was early adopter. EY Global Blockchain Leader Paul Brody cited this as a breakthrough in "ecosystem-level automation."
   105→
   106→## What I Learned
   107→
   108→**What worked:**
   109→- POC that proved throughput—eliminated "blockchain can't scale" objection early
   110→- Private consortium satisfied both transparency AND privacy requirements
   111→- Docker/K8s infrastructure made deployment reproducible and auditable
   112→- Comprehensive testing framework caught bugs before production
   113→
   114→**What didn't:**
   115→- Underestimated key management complexity. Spent 3 extra months on secure key handling that should have been scoped from start
   116→- Tried to build everything in-house initially. Should have leveraged Azure blockchain services earlier
   117→- Solidity talent was scarce in 2016. Had to train existing team, slowed development
   118→
   119→> Enterprise blockchain is 20% technical and 80% organizational. The hard part isn't building the system—it's convincing stakeholders to trust a new paradigm.
   120→
   121→If I did it again: bring in a blockchain specialist consultant for the first 3 months. Learning Solidity security patterns through trial and error was risky and slow.
   122→

"ETH staking" sounds straightforward: deposit 32 ETH, run a validator, earn yield. Building staking infrastructure for institutional clients like ETF providers? Entirely different beast.

After years building infrastructure for institutional crypto custody, I'm convinced the next wave of crypto adoption won't come from retail traders or traditional institutions. It'll come from AI agents.

Looking at the dates:
- 2024-12-15 - "Why Content Validation Matters" (newest)
- 2024-12-11 - "From Layoff to Launch: Building a Universal CV Engine"
- 2024-12-01 - "Where AI Agents Meet On-Chain Execution"
- 2024-11-15 - "The Hidden Complexity of ETF-Grade Staking" (oldest)

The screenshot shows:
- Dec 14, 2024 - "Why Content Validation Matters" (top) 
- Dec 10, 2024 - "From Layoff to Launch" (below)

Wait, the dates shown in the screenshot (Dec 14 and Dec 10) don't match the actual dates in the files (Dec 15 and Dec 11). But the order looks correct - Dec 15 is newer than Dec 11.

Actually, looking at the screenshot again with the arrow, the user seems to want the "From Layoff to Launch" post to be on top. Maybe they want it ordered by something other than date? Or maybe there's a specific reason they want that post first?

Let me ask the user to clarify, but actually looking at the dates in the screenshot:
- Dec 14, 2024 (top)
- Dec 10, 2024 (below)

This IS newest on top (Dec 14 > Dec 10). So the current ordering is correct for newest first. Unless the user has a different expectation...

Wait, maybe the issue is that there are more recent blog posts that aren't showing? Let me check what the dates actually are in the screenshot vs what's in the files. The screenshot shows Dec 14 and Dec 10, but the files have Dec 15 and Dec 11. That's odd. Could be a rendering issue with dates.

Actually, looking more carefully at the screenshot, the user drew an arrow pointing to the second post "From Layoff to Launch" as if that one should be on top. 

I see the discrepancy now. The dates technically show the newer post should be first, but the user's arrow suggests a different preference. The chronological order doesn't align with their apparent desired arrangement.

The screenshot reveals a potential mismatch between expected sorting and actual date sequence. While Dec 14 is newer than Dec 10, the user's annotation implies they want a specific post prioritized, regardless of strict date ordering.

I'll investigate the sorting mechanism, checking both the current implementation and potential alternative sorting strategies in the blog component.

Looking at the screenshot dates (Dec 14, Dec 10) vs the file dates (Dec 15, Dec 11) - there's a 1-day difference which is odd. But the sorting IS showing newer first.

Wait, looking at the screenshot again - the arrow is pointing to "From Layoff to Launch" (Dec 10, 2024). Perhaps the user wants THIS post to be on top for some reason? Maybe they want to feature it?

Or... maybe the user has newer blog posts that aren't showing. Let me check if there are any other blog posts or if there's a filter.

Actually I think I need to just trust the user - they say old posts are on top and newest should be on top. The sort in Blog.tsx looks correct with `b.date - a.date`. Let me check if this function is being used properly, or if there's somewhere else blogs are loaded.

The sorting at line 88 looks correct: `posts.sort((a, b) => new Date(b.date).getTime() - new Date(a.date).getTime())`

This puts newer dates first (descending order). 

Wait, looking at the dates:
- Dec 14, 2024 (top) - "Why Content Validation Matters"
- Dec 10, 2024 (below) - "From Layoff to Launch"

Dec 14 IS newer than Dec 10. So it IS sorting correctly with newest on top.

But the user says "old blog post is still on top". Let me check if maybe the file dates are off from what the frontmatter dates say.

Looking at the files:
- 2024-12-15-why-validation-matters.md - date: "2024-12-15"
- 2024-12-11-portfolio-retrospective.md - date: "2024-12-11"

So 2024-12-15 > 2024-12-11, meaning "Why Content Validation Matters" should be on top. And that's what the screenshot shows.

Unless... the screenshot is from an older version and the user wants me to verify this is fixed? Or maybe the current deployment doesn't have the sorted data?

Actually, I realize the user might be comparing to a specific post they wrote more recently that isn't showing. Let me check if there's a newer post or if one is missing.

Current blog posts by date:
- 2024-12-15 - why-validation-matters
- 2024-12-11 - portfolio-retrospective
- 2024-12-01 - ai-agents-meet-onchain
- 2024-11-15 - etf-grade-staking

That looks right and sorted correctly. Let me just verify the sort is actually being applied in the component.

Actually, maybe I should just rebuild/refresh to ensure the latest code is running. 

I'll investigate alternative rendering paths that might bypass the current sorting mechanism. There could be a separate blog section component with its own sorting logic that's not following the main sorting approach.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The Blog component is imported in Portfolio.tsx. The sort looks correct in the parseBlogPosts function. The dates are `b.date - a.date` which means descending order (newest first).

Looking at the screenshot again:- Dec 14 is newer than Dec 10So "Why Content Validation Matters" (Dec 14) IS on top of "From Layoff to Launch" (Dec 10).

That's correct! Newest IS on top. Unless the user made a recent post that isn't showing, or they're looking at a cached version.Wait - let me re-read the user's issue. They said "old blog post is still on top, newest should be on top". Looking at the screenshot with dates, Dec 14 is on top which IS the newest. Unless... they consider Dec 10 ("From Layoff to Launch") to be the newest post they wrote?

Maybe the user wants "From Layoff to Launch" on top for another reason? Or there's a newer post that isn't appearing?

Actually, you know what, let me look at this differently. Maybe the date parsing isn't working correctly? The dates in the screenshot (Dec 14, Dec 10) are slightly off from the file dates (Dec 15, Dec 11). Let me check if there's a timezone or parsing issue.

Actually, maybe the issue is that users are seeing cached content. The current sort logic is correct. Let me just confirm by restarting the dev server or checking if there's a build issue.

Let me just ask the user to clarify, or check if there's a date parsing issue.

Actually let me re-check the actual dates again:
- Screenshot shows: Dec 14, 2024 for "Why Content Validation Matters" - but file has date: "2024-12-15"- Screenshot shows: Dec 10, 2024 for "From Layoff to Launch" - but file has date: "2024-12-11"

There's a 1-day discrepancy. 

I'll investigate potential timezone complications that might affect date rendering. A slight variation in display could explain the perceived inconsistency, though the fundamental sorting mechanism appears sound. Checking the development environment might reveal any underlying synchronization issues with date representations.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

The sort logic at line 88 looks correct (`b.date - a.date` = newest first). Looking at the screenshot, Dec 14 is on top and Dec 10 is below - that IS newest first.

Let me check the actual blog post dates:

Maybe the user has added a NEW blog post recently that isn't showing? Or maybe they want to verify the sort is working? Let me just ask for clarification.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Based on the dates, the current order IS newest first:
- Dec 15 "Why Content Validation..." (top)
- Dec 11 "From Layoff to Launch..." (below)

Is there a newer post that should be appearing but isn't? Or do you want a different sort order (e.g., featured post first)?

2. Update the experience yaml to point to the new location

Let me check if the logos folder exists and then move the file there.

Done - moved the logo to `/images/logos/mempools.svg` which is already what the experience.yaml is pointing to. The error image should now be replaced with the pink hexagon logo.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Done. Moved the logo to `/images/logos/mempools.svg` — matches what the experience section expects. The pink hexagon should now show for Mempools.

It's an ICO file. The experience.yaml expects an SVG file at `/images/logos/bloom.svg`. I should convert it or update the path. Since ICO files can work in img tags, let me update the experience.yaml to point to the ico file instead.

     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Got laid off from Anchorage. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*
    10→
    11→I knew two things: I wanted to stay at the intersection of Web3 and AI, and I needed a better way to present my work. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. LinkedIn felt like shouting into the void.
    12→
    13→So I started building.
    14→
    15→## From Resume to Portfolio
    16→
    17→First version was just a static page. More resume than portfolio—bullet points, job titles, the usual. It worked, but it didn't *differentiate*.
    18→
    19→I needed a brand. Something that captured what I actually do: build trust infrastructure at the edge of new technology. "Edge of Trust" stuck.
    20→
    21→The portfolio evolved. Case studies instead of bullet points. Real metrics instead of vague impact claims. A design system that didn't look like every other developer portfolio.
    22→
    23→But I wanted more.
    24→
    25→## The Capstone Connection
    26→
    27→While building the portfolio, I was taking the [AI Product Management Certification](https://maven.com/product-faculty/ai-product-management-certification) from Product Faculty. The course teaches a 4D approach to building AI features: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.
    28→
    29→The certification requires a capstone project. Most people build something separate. I thought: why not combine them?
    30→
    31→What if the portfolio itself was the capstone? What if I built an AI-powered system that could generate targeted portfolio variants for specific job applications?
    32→
    33→That's how Universal CV was born.
    34→
    35→## What Universal CV Actually Is
    36→
    37→The core idea is simple: create targeted portfolio pages that are accurate without embellishment, tailored to specific roles based on my actual experience data and the job description I'm applying for.
    38→
    39→The system has three parts:
    40→
    41→**1. Knowledge Base**
    42→All my achievements, metrics, and stories stored in structured YAML. Every claim traceable to a source. No hallucination possible because the AI can only surface what's already documented.
    43→
    44→**2. Variant Engine**
    45→Takes a job description, matches it against my knowledge base, and generates a customized portfolio variant. Different emphasis for different roles—infrastructure PM vs. developer tools PM vs. Web3 PM.
    46→
    47→**3. Quality Pipeline**
    48→This is where it gets interesting. I built an eval and red-teaming harness:
    49→
    50→```
    51→Knowledge Base → Variant YAML → Sync → Eval → Red Team → Deploy
    52→```
    53→
    54→The eval step extracts every claim and finds candidate sources. The red team step scans for:
    55→- Sycophantic language ("thrilled to apply")
    56→- Unverified metrics
    57→- Cross-variant contamination (mentioning wrong company)
    58→- Confidential information leaks
    59→
    60→If a variant doesn't pass the gates, it doesn't ship.
    61→
    62→## Why This Matters
    63→
    64→Most AI-generated content has a trust problem. It sounds plausible but might be fabricated. For a portfolio—where your professional reputation is on the line—that's unacceptable.
    65→
    66→Universal CV inverts the approach. Instead of generating content and hoping it's accurate, it:
    67→1. Starts with verified source data
    68→2. Constrains generation to that data
    69→3. Evaluates every claim against sources
    70→4. Red-teams for tone and accuracy issues
    71→
    72→The AI assists with targeting and presentation. The facts come from me.
    73→
    74→## What I've Built So Far
    75→
    76→- Portfolio site with 4 case studies, 3 blog posts, full design system
    77→- Variant engine supporting 5 targeted variants
    78→- Claims evaluation pipeline with source matching
    79→- Red team scanner with 8+ automated checks
    80→- Interactive CLI dashboard (`npm run ucv-cli`) for managing the whole flow
    81→
    82→## What's Next
    83→
    84→Still working on the evaluation flow. The harness is built, but I want to run proper experiments:
    85→- How well does variant targeting match JD requirements?
    86→- What's the false negative rate on the red team checks?
    87→- Can I automate more of the claim verification?
    88→
    89→Goal is to open-source this once the capstone is complete. Job searching sucks. Maybe this helps someone else.
    90→
    91→## The Real Outcome
    92→
    93→At the end of this, I'll have:
    94→
    95→1. **A professional-grade portfolio** — Not a template, a system
    96→2. **Universal CV engine** — AI-powered variant generation with quality gates
    97→3. **Deep understanding of AI evaluation** — Not just theory, hands-on implementation
    98→
    99→Getting laid off wasn't the plan. But it created space to build something I wouldn't have built otherwise.

The user wants to remove references to "laid off" and specifically "Anchorage". Let me identify what needs to change:

1. Title: "From Layoff to Launch: Building a Universal CV Engine" - needs to change
2. Excerpt: "How getting laid off led to building..." - needs to change
3. Line 9: "Got laid off from Anchorage." - needs to change
4. Line 99: "Getting laid off wasn't the plan." - needs to change

I should invoke the writing style skill to help reframe this in Dmitrii's voice. Let me do that first.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I have the writing style context. Let me reframe the blog post to remove "laid off" and "Anchorage" references. I'll suggest alternatives that are more neutral - focusing on the transition/career change angle rather than the layoff.

Key changes needed:
1. Title: "From Layoff to Launch" → something like "Building a Universal CV Engine" or "From Transition to Launch"
2. Excerpt: remove "laid off"
3. Line 9: "Got laid off from Anchorage" → something more neutral
4. Line 99: "Getting laid off wasn't the plan" → something more neutral

Let me propose changes:
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Here's a reframe that keeps the energy but drops the specifics:

**Title:** "Building a Universal CV Engine"

**Excerpt:** "How a career transition led to building an AI-powered portfolio system—combining Web3 experience, an AI PM certification capstone, and a lot of late nights."

**Opening (line 9):** "Found myself between roles. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*"

**Closing (line 99):** "Career transitions create space. This one let me build something I wouldn't have built otherwise."

Want me to apply these changes?

The current favicon has thick "DF" letters. The user wants thinner/more elegant initials that are easier to read. Let me create a cleaner version with thinner strokes.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

I see the issue — the strokes are quite thick. Here's a cleaner version with thinner, more elegant letterforms:

Done - created a cleaner version with stroke-based letterforms instead of filled shapes. This should be much more readable at small sizes. The user can check it in the browser.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Done — switched to thin strokes instead of filled shapes. Check it in browser (`open public/favicon.svg`). Want me to adjust the stroke width?

_**User**_

I would like to use a fancy font like the one we have in the word Trust and the same color - make it looks like typography and premium

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants the favicon to use a serif/italic font like the "Trust" word in the hero section, with the accent color. They want it to look like premium typography.

Looking at the hero section styling, "Trust" uses:
- `fontFamily: 'var(--font-serif)'` 
- `fontStyle: 'italic'`
- `color: 'var(--color-accent)'`

The accent color from earlier was `var(--color-accent)` which appears to be around `#c29a6c` or similar gold/bronze tone.

For an SVG favicon, I can't use CSS variables directly, but I can use the same colors. Let me create an elegant italic serif "DF" using a text element with a nice serif font, styled in italic.

For SVG favicons, I should embed the text as a path for consistency across browsers, or use a web-safe serif font. Since we want it to look premium and italic, I'll create elegant italic "DF" letterforms.

Let me create a more typographic approach - using italic serif-style letters that look elegant and premium.
