I'm ready and warmed up! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI specialist for exploring codebases. I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode and can help you:

- Search for files using glob patterns
- Find code and text using regex with grep
- Read and analyze specific file contents
- Navigate and explore your codebase efficiently

I can see you're in the `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` directory, which is a git repository on the main branch. I'm prepared to help you search through your code and report findings clearly with absolute file paths and relevant code snippets.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

I'll help you log in to Claude Code. Let me run the login command for you.

The login command is running interactively. It's likely waiting for you to complete authentication in your browser or terminal. 

If a browser window opened, please complete the authentication there. If you're seeing prompts in another terminal, follow those instructions.

Would you like me to check the status again, or is there something specific you need help with regarding the login process?
