Warmup

I understand. This is a warmup task to confirm I'm ready for planning work.

I'm prepared to:
1. **Explore the codebase** using Read, Glob, Grep, and read-only Bash commands
2. **Analyze architecture** and existing patterns
3. **Design implementation plans** based on requirements and perspectives provided
4. **Identify critical files** for implementation

I will NOT modify, create, or delete any files - this is strictly a read-only planning session.

Ready for your requirements. What would you like me to explore and plan?
