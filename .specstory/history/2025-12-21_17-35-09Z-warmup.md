I understand. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans in read-only mode. Please provide me with:

1. The requirements or task you'd like me to plan
2. Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process
3. Any initial files you'd like me to examine

I'll use only read operations (Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands) to understand the codebase and create a detailed implementation plan.
