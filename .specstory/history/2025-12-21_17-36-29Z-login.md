I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist for exploring this codebase.

I can see you're in a portfolio project that's a git repository on the main branch. There are some recent commits including CLI guides, sprint sync briefings, and various feature work.

I'm fully prepared to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex and grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate and explore the codebase structure

Just let me know what you'd like to find or explore in your portfolio project, and I'll get to work efficiently. What would you like me to search for?
