I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm in READ-ONLY mode ready to search and analyze your codebase.

Let me verify the environment is working:

**Current Status:**
- Working directory: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio`
- Git repo: Yes (on `main` branch)
- Platform: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)
- Date: 2025-12-21

I can efficiently help you:
- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code with regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate your codebase structure

What would you like me to search for or explore in your portfolio project?

I understand this is a warmup prompt. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans in read-only mode.

I can see from the git status that I'm working in a portfolio project at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` on the `main` branch. There are some uncommitted changes to `.claude/settings.local.json` and an untracked `.specstory/` directory.

When you're ready, please provide me with:
1. The requirements or task you'd like me to plan
2. Optionally, a specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take

I'll then explore the codebase thoroughly using read-only operations and provide a detailed implementation plan with critical files identified.

I'll help you log in to Claude Code. Let me run the login command:

The login command is running interactively. It's waiting for you to complete the authentication flow in your browser or terminal.

The `claude login` command typically:
1. Opens a browser window for authentication
2. Or provides a URL you can visit to authenticate

Please check your browser or follow any prompts that appeared. Once you complete the authentication, the command will finish.

Would you like me to check the output again, or is there something specific about the login process you need help with?
