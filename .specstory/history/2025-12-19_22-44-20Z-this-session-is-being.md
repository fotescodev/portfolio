This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me analyze the conversation chronologically:

1. **Initial Context (from summary)**: The conversation started with UX improvements including:
   - Converting blog modal to a routed page
   - Adding company links in experience section
   - Creating `/run-tests` skill
   - Fixing navbar consistency
   - Fixing double hash URL issue

2. **Navbar Menu Update**: User requested updating navbar menu to: Experience | Cases | Blog | About | Get in Touch (pointing to footer)
   - Added `id="experience"` to ExperienceSection
   - Added `id="contact"` to FooterSection
   - Updated Portfolio.tsx and BlogPostPage.tsx navbars
   - Updated navigation tests to use "Cases" instead of "Work"

3. **Code Block Styling Issues**: User reported code blocks looked weird with per-line backgrounds
   - Fixed by adding CSS: `.code-content code { background: transparent !important; }` and `.code-content span { background: transparent !important; }`

4. **Blog Footer/Author Card**: User wanted:
   - Clear CTA for recruiters at end of blog article
   - Padding below "About Dmitrii" card
   - Initially I mistakenly added a CTA section to the homepage footer, user corrected me
   - Moved the action bar (Copy Email, Resume, Let's Talk) to the blog article's author card instead

5. **Spacing and Light Mode Issues**: User reported:
   - Author card spacing looked weird
   - Code looked blurry in light mode (was using `oneDark` for both modes)
   - Fixed by changing to `oneLight` for light mode and adjusting spacing

6. **Blog Article Improvements**: User asked how I would improve the blog view, then said "implement all of the above":
   - Prev/Next Article Navigation
   - Table of Contents (sticky sidebar desktop, collapsible mobile)
   - Mobile hamburger menu
   - Open Graph Meta Tags
   - Drop cap styling
   - Reading time remaining indicator
   - Lazy loading/blur-up for images
   - Keyboard navigation (j/k, Escape)
   - Print styles
   - Anchor links on headings

7. **User Feedback During Implementation**:
   - "also the clapping hands icon looks weird" - Changed to simpler heart icon
   - "table of contents looks weird (color) in dark mode" and "also in light mode" - Fixed TOC styling to use transparent backgrounds and proper CSS variables

8. **Final State**: All 192 tests passing after implementing all features

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   - Update navbar menu to: Experience | Cases | Blog | About | Get in Touch (scrolling to footer)
   - Fix code block styling issues (per-line backgrounds, blurry in light mode)
   - Add clear CTA for recruiters in blog article's "About Dmitrii" card (not homepage footer)
   - Implement 10 blog article UX improvements: prev/next navigation, TOC, mobile menu, Open Graph tags, drop cap, reading time indicator, lazy loading images, keyboard navigation, print styles, anchor links on headings
   - Fix clapping hands icon (changed to heart)
   - Fix TOC colors in both dark and light mode

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - React Router HashRouter navigation
   - CSS Variables for theming
   - react-syntax-highlighter with oneDark/oneLight themes
   - ReactMarkdown with custom component renderers
   - react-helmet-async for meta tags
   - Intersection Observer pattern (for TOC active state)
   - Keyboard event handling
   - Print media queries
   - Image lazy loading with blur-up effect

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - **`src/pages/BlogPostPage.tsx`** (Major updates - all blog improvements)
     - Added imports: `Helmet`, `useCallback`
     - Added new states: `mobileMenuOpen`, `tocOpen`, `imageLoaded`, `emailCopied`
     - Added `readingTimeRemaining` calculation
     - Added keyboard navigation effect (j/k/Escape)
     - Added extensive CSS for new features
     - Key CSS additions:
     ```css
     /* Drop cap */
     .blog-prose > p:first-of-type::first-letter { float: left; font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 3.5em; ... }
     
     /* Prev/Next navigation */
     .post-nav { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; ... }
     
     /* Print styles */
     @media print { .progress-bar, .blog-nav, ... { display: none !important; } }
     
     /* TOC - fixed for dark/light mode */
     .toc-container { background: transparent; border: none; }
     .toc-item { background: transparent; border-left: 2px solid var(--color-border-light); ... }
     ```
     - Added Open Graph meta tags via Helmet
     - Added mobile menu overlay
     - Added desktop TOC sidebar
     - Added mobile TOC toggle
     - Changed clap button to heart icon
     - Added blur-up loading for hero images
     - Added heading anchor links in ReactMarkdown components
     - Added prev/next navigation
     - Added keyboard hints

   - **`src/components/sections/FooterSection.tsx`**
     - Added `id="contact"` for navbar scroll target
     - Reverted from CTA section back to simple footer (user corrected me)

   - **`src/components/sections/ExperienceSection.tsx`**
     - Added `id="experience"` for navbar scroll target

   - **`src/components/Portfolio.tsx`**
     - Updated desktop nav: `[{ label: 'Experience', id: 'experience' }, { label: 'Cases', id: 'work' }, { label: 'Blog', id: 'blog' }, { label: 'About', id: 'about' }]`
     - Updated mobile menu with same structure plus "Get in Touch"
     - Changed "Get in Touch" from calendar link to `#contact` scroll

   - **`src/tests/navigation/navigation.test.tsx`**
     - Updated test to look for "Cases" link instead of "Work"
     - Added 'experience' and 'contact' to getElementById mock

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Navigation tests failed** after navbar update: Tests looked for `/work/i` but link was now "Cases"
     - Fixed by changing test to use `/cases/i`
   - **Code blocks had per-line backgrounds**: SyntaxHighlighter's oneDark style added backgrounds
     - Fixed with CSS: `.code-content code { background: transparent !important; }` and `.code-content span { background: transparent !important; }`
   - **Code blurry in light mode**: Was using `oneDark` for both modes (`style={isDark ? oneDark : oneDark}`)
     - Fixed to `style={isDark ? oneDark : oneLight}`
   - **Homepage footer had CTA section by mistake**: User said "you added it to the main page as well by mistake"
     - Reverted FooterSection.tsx to simple version, added action bar to BlogPostPage author card instead
   - **Clapping hands icon looked weird**: User feedback
     - Changed to simpler heart icon SVG
   - **TOC colors weird in dark/light mode**: User feedback
     - Fixed by removing background from `.toc-container`, making `.toc-item` use transparent background

5. Problem Solving:
   - Solved modal exit issue by converting blog to routed page (from previous context)
   - Solved navbar inconsistency across pages
   - Solved code block styling issues
   - Implemented comprehensive blog article UX improvements
   - All 192 tests passing

6. All user messages:
   - "ok, finally let's update the inconsistent navbar menu: Experience (points to Experience Section) | Cases | Blog | About | Get in Touch (should point to the footer of the homepage)"
   - "the code looks weird on the blog article" (with screenshot showing per-line backgrounds)
   - "finally, the blog footer seems too noisy without a clear call to action in the end...the outcome is for the recruiter to get in touch with me - also, the About Dmitrii card is right on the bottom without any padding below which creates a feel of slopiness"
   - "you added it to the main page as well by mistake - this should be added into About Dmitrii card on the article page instead."
   - "Spacing looks weird, and the code looks blurry in light mode" (with screenshots)
   - "last review - how would you improve the blog article view?"
   - "implement all of the above"
   - "use the /run-tests skill after you have it implemented"
   - "also the clapping hands icon looks weird"
   - "table of contents looks weird (color) in dark mode"
   - "also in light mode"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - None explicitly stated - all requested features have been implemented

8. Current Work:

<think><details>Looking at the conversation summary and the todo list, I was in the middle of implementing blog article UX improvements. The todo list shows:

1. "Add Prev/Next article navigation at bottom" - in_progress
2. "Implement Table of Contents (sticky sidebar desktop, collapsible mobile)" - pending
3. "Add mobile hamburger menu with full navigation" - pending
4. "Add Open Graph meta tags for social sharing" - pending
5. "Add drop cap styling for first paragraph" - pending
6. "Show reading time remaining indicator" - pending
7. "Add lazy loading and blur-up for images" - pending
8. "Implement keyboard navigation (j/k, Escape)" - pending
9. "Add print styles" - pending
10. "Add anchor links on headings" - pending

However, the summary says all 10 features were implemented and all 192 tests were passing. The summary also mentions that:
- The clapping icon was changed to a heart
- TOC colors were fixed for both dark and light mode

The todo list seems out of sync with the actual state (probably because the context was truncated mid-work). According to the summary, everything was completed.

Let me verify the current state by running tests and checking the BlogPostPage.tsx to see what's actually implemented. The summary says all 192 tests are passing and all features are done.

I should:
1. Run the tests to verify current state
2. Check if the BlogPostPage has all the features
3. Update the todo list to reflect completion

Let me start by running the tests to see the current state.</details></think>
