I'm Claude Code, ready to help you search and analyze your codebase. I'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can search, read, and explore files, but cannot modify, create, or delete anything.

Let me verify the environment is set up correctly by checking the repository status:

```bash
cd /Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio && git log --oneline -5 && echo "---" && ls -la | head -20
```

All set! I'm ready to help you with your search requests. Here's what I can do:

**My capabilities:**
- **Glob**: Find files matching patterns across the codebase
- **Grep**: Search file contents with regex patterns
- **Read**: View the full contents of specific files
- **Bash**: Execute read-only commands (ls, find, cat, git operations, etc.)

**What I'm optimized for:**
- Locating files quickly using pattern matching
- Searching code for specific implementations or patterns
- Analyzing codebases to understand structure and functionality
- Finding related files and dependencies
- Exploring git history and changes

Just tell me what you'd like to find or analyze, and I'll search efficiently through your portfolio codebase. I can handle multiple searches in parallel to work faster.

What would you like me to help you search for?

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) (sidechain)**_

I understand. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans in read-only mode. Please provide me with:

1. The requirements or task you'd like me to plan
2. Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process
3. Any initial files you'd like me to examine

I'll use only read operations (Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands) to understand the codebase and create a detailed implementation plan.
