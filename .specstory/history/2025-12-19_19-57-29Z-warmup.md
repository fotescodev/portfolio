I understand. This is a warmup/ready check. I'm prepared to explore the codebase and design implementation plans in read-only mode.

I have access to the portfolio project at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` on the `feature/universal-cv-data-ingestion` branch. I can see there's a modified `.claude/settings.local.json` file and recent commits related to CV data ingestion features.

I'm ready to receive requirements and begin the planning process. What would you like me to explore and design?
