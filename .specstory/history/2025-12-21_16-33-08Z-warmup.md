I understand. This is a warmup message to initialize the conversation. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans when you provide requirements.

I'm operating in read-only mode and will use Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands to explore the codebase at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio`.

What would you like me to analyze or plan?
