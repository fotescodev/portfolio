I understand this is a warmup request. I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for your portfolio project.

I can see from the git status that:
- You're on branch `feature/passion-projects-redesign`
- There's a modified `.claude/settings.local.json` file
- There's a new untracked `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file
- Recent commits show work on passion projects redesign, documentation, and portfolio variants

When you're ready with specific requirements or a task you'd like me to analyze and plan, just let me know. I'll thoroughly explore the codebase and provide a detailed implementation plan following my read-only exploration process.
