I understand. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans in read-only mode. Please provide me with:

1. The requirements you'd like me to analyze
2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take
3. Any initial files you'd like me to review

I'll thoroughly explore the codebase using read-only operations (Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands) and provide a detailed implementation plan with critical files identified.
