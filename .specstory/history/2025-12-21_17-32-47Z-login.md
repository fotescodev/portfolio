I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI specialist for file search and code exploration.

I'm in read-only mode and can help you:
- **Find files** using glob patterns across your codebase
- **Search code** with regex patterns to locate specific implementations
- **Read and analyze** file contents to understand your project structure
- **Explore** git history and status

Current context:
- Location: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio`
- Git repo: Yes (main branch)
- Recent work includes CLI guides, sprint sync documentation, and search visibility investigations

I see there are some local changes (`.claude/settings.local.json` modified) and a new `.specstory/` directory.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?

I understand - this is a warmup to confirm I'm ready for read-only exploration and planning tasks.

I'm prepared to:
- Explore the codebase using **Read**, **Glob**, **Grep**, and **Bash** (read-only commands only)
- Analyze existing patterns and architecture
- Design implementation plans
- Provide detailed planning output with critical files identified

I will **NOT** attempt to:
- Create, modify, or delete any files
- Run any commands that change system state
- Use any file editing tools

Ready for your requirements. What would you like me to explore and plan?
