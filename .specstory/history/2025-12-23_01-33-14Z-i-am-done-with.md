<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to create social media content to promote their portfolio. They want:
1. LinkedIn post (short)
2. LinkedIn article (longer form)
3. X.com (Twitter) post
4. YouTube video with transcript

The goals are:
1. Share news and drive traffic
2. Share top 3 learnings
3. Create a hook for next post/engagement

Before I can plan this properly, I need to understand:
1. What is the portfolio about? Let me explore the codebase to understand what was built
2. What are the key features/learnings that would be worth sharing?
3. What is Dmitrii's writing style (there's a skill for this)?

Let me start by exploring the portfolio to understand what was built, and also look at any existing content that might help me understand the project better.

I should launch Explore agents to understand:
1. The portfolio itself - what it is, key features
2. Any existing content/case studies that might inform the social posts
3. The project state/documentation to understand what was accomplished

This is Phase 1 - Initial Understanding. Let me launch explore agents.

---

### 3. What Makes It Unique & Innovative

**Innovation #1: Trust-First AI Content**
Most AI-generated portfolios hallucinate. This one inverts the approach:
- All facts stored in a knowledge base first
- AI constrained to that data only
- Every claim evaluated against sources
- Red-teamed for accuracy/tone before deployment
- This is a novel pattern for AI-assisted professional content

**Innovation #2: Dynamic Portfolio Variants**
Not a static resume. Instead:
- Single source of truth (base profile + knowledge base)
- Automatically generates 9+ personalized variants
- Each variant optimized for different company/role combos
- Seamlessly shareable as URLs (hash-routed, GitHub Pages compatible)
- Job description matching informs content emphasis

**Innovation #3: Capstone-Grade Quality Pipeline**
The portfolio itself doubles as an AI Product Management certification capstone:
- Implements full 4D lifecycle (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver)
- Uses production-grade eval/red-teaming patterns
- Machine-checkable verification ledgers
- Could be open-sourced as reference implementation

**Innovation #4: Design System as Single Source of Truth**
- 122+ CSS variables governing every visual aspect
- Enforced theme parity (dark/light modes)
- No hardcoded pixels/colors in components
- Enables consistent theming across all personalized variants

**Innovation #5: Premium Positioning**
- Instrument Serif/Sans typography (premium feel, not generic)
- Elegant color palette (#c29a6c accent, refined neutrals)
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Premium orb effects in ambient background
- Differentiates from typical developer portfolios

**Innovation #6: Content Depth**
- Not template-based—bespoke case studies with real metrics
- Decision narratives showing trade-offs and reasoning
- Blog posts about process (meta-content about building the portfolio)
- LinkedIn-quality depth, but more interactive

---

- Most portfolios are static. This one is dynamic (variants + personalization)
- Most use AI for generation. This one constrains AI with verified source data
- Most focus on design. This one focuses on substance (deep case studies)
- Most are personal branding. This one is a working capstone product
- Most hide the system. This one documents it (open-sourcing roadmap)

**The Meta Angle:**
The portfolio itself is a portfolio piece. It demonstrates:
- Product thinking (eval pipeline, QA gates)
- Systems design (variant architecture, knowledge base)
- AI product maturity (trust, verification, evaluation)
- Technical craftsmanship (React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7, Zod)

This appeals to PM hiring managers, AI/ML companies, and serious product people.

<summary>Tool use: **Task**</summary>
 Find portfolio learnings/insights
```
Perfect! I now have comprehensive insights across the entire portfolio. Let me compile the findings into a compelling summary with the top 3 learnings.

## Summary: Top 3 Learnings from Your Portfolio

Based on my thorough search through your blog posts, case studies, retrospective content, and project documentation, here are the **top 3 learnings** that stand out as the most insightful and shareable:

---

### Learning #1: **Distribution Beats Product** 
**Source:** Mempools case study + Ankr case study

The most powerful recurring theme across your work is that **who you partner with matters more than what you build**. Two specific examples:

- **Mempools**: Instead of competing for developers directly, you launched as the *default alerting provider on Archway mainnet*. One partnership with a protocol gave you instant distribution and credibility worth 100 marketing campaigns.
- **Ankr**: The tipping point wasn't a better RPC product—it was pivoting from developers to protocols as customers. Protocol partnerships became worth 10x the revenue of individual developer accounts.

**Social Media Angle**: "Built better products. They didn't matter. What mattered was who recommended us. Distribution changes everything."

---

### Learning #2: **Customer Isn't Always User—Find the Right Unit Economics**
**Source:** Ankr & Protocol Integration Framework cases

This is a subtle but game-changing insight:

- **Ankr**: Realized blockchain protocols needed infrastructure more than individual developers. Shifting your customer focus (not your product) from developers to protocols improved unit economics overnight and unlocked 15× revenue growth.
- **Protocol Integration**: Instead of hiring more people to handle integration bottlenecks, you built a framework that made your existing team 2× more effective—same team, 40% faster integrations, saved ~$200K in hiring costs.

The lesson: **sometimes the unit economics problem isn't about building better—it's about building smarter by changing who you're optimizing for**.

**Social Media Angle**: "Spent months building features. One conversation with a different customer segment solved the unit economics problem instantly."

---

### Learning #3: **Trust Is Your Moat in Institutional Markets**
**Source:** ETF-Grade Staking blog + Xbox Royalties case study

Your institutional crypto and enterprise work reveals a consistent pattern:

- **ETF Staking**: "Institutional clients want boring. They don't want the best APY. They want predictable, auditable, defensible infrastructure." The moat isn't performance—it's compliance.
- **Xbox Royalties**: "Enterprise blockchain is 20% technical and 80% organizational. The hard part isn't building the system—it's convincing stakeholders to trust a new paradigm."
- **Universal CV Engine**: Your capstone project inverts the trust problem: instead of generating content and hoping it's accurate, start with verified source data, constrain generation to that data, and red-team for accuracy.

**Social Media Angle**: "Everyone's building faster. Institutions are buying trust. Document everything, audit everything, make it defensible. That's the moat."

---

## Secondary Insights Worth Highlighting

**Learning #4: Content Validation Is Infrastructure** (from your blog post)
- Treat content as code. Zod schemas + automated validation catch errors before production. This applies beyond portfolios to any content-driven product.

**Learning #5: In AI Infrastructure, Cost Control Beats Optimization** (from AI Agent Orchestration)
- Developers won't adopt AI infrastructure they can't budget for. Competitive moat is operational reliability, not algorithmic innovation.

---

## Recommended Social Media Posts

Here are three high-engagement frameworks:

**Post 1** (Distribution Beats Product):
> "We built better products. Competitors still won. The difference? We launched as the recommended solution for an entire ecosystem instead of fighting for developer attention. Partnership > Features. Distribution > Product. #ProductManagement"

**Post 2** (Customer/User Mismatch):
> "Spent 8 months trying to win developer market. Made $130K ARR. Shifted focus from developers to the protocols they use as customers. Revenue 15×'d in 6 months. Sometimes the unit economics problem isn't your product—it's your customer definition. #SaaS"

**Post 3** (Trust as Moat):
> "Everyone's racing to build faster. In institutional crypto, I learned: speed doesn't matter. Auditability matters. Compliance matters. Trust matters. Built a royalty system for 2.7B+ Xbox consumers because it was defensible—not because it was the best. #Enterprise"

---

## File References

All these learnings are documented in:
- **Retrospective blog**: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/content/blog/2024-12-22-portfolio-retrospective.md`
- **Case studies**: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/content/case-studies/` (01-mempools.md, 02-ankr-rpc.md, 03-xbox-royalties.md)

 Review Dmitrii's writing style
```
Excellent! I've found all the documentation about Dmitrii's writing style. Here's a comprehensive summary:

## Dmitrii's Writing Style Documentation

### Official Style Guide
**Location:** `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/.claude/skills/dmitrii-writing-style/SKILL.md`

The skill documentation defines these core characteristics:

#### Voice Characteristics
- **Direct and Action-Oriented**: Gets to the point, leads with substance, values clarity over elaborate setups
- **Warm but Professional**: Friendly without being informal, natural conversational language, no corporate-speak
- **Intellectually Curious**: Probes deeper, asks "why," willing to admit uncertainty ("it feels that this is a bit over my head")
- **Practical Problem-Solver**: Always oriented toward what can be built, shipped, or acted upon

#### Formatting Preferences

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Bullet points in emails or conversational contexts
- Excessive bold/headers in short communications
- Numbered lists unless truly sequential steps
- HTML tags in copy-paste contexts
- Robotic or overly formal phrasing
- Generic corporate language

**Preferred Patterns:**
- Flowing prose in emails and messages with natural transitions
- Tables for structured comparisons in documents
- Clear hierarchy in technical docs, minimal in casual communication
- One request per sentence in emails

#### Vocabulary Preferences
**Prefer:**
- "scope out" over "define"
- "crisp and clear" over "concise"
- "flows well" over "is readable"
- "makes sense" over "is logical"
- "up my alley" over "aligned with my interests"
- "crack [a problem]" over "solve"
- Active voice throughout

**Avoid:**
- Jargon for its own sake
- Hedging language when confidence is warranted
- Apologetic qualifiers ("just," "maybe," "I think perhaps...")
- Filler phrases ("In order to," "It should be noted that...")

#### Domain Expertise
Dmitrii operates at the intersection of:
- Web3/Blockchain (protocol terminology, tokenomics, on-chain concepts)
- Product Management (JTBD, MoSCoW, user stories, roadmaps)
- Institutional Compliance (KYC/AML, regulatory frameworks)
- AI/Agents (agent identity, attestation, autonomy)

#### Quality Checks Before Finalizing
1. Could this be said more directly?
2. Are there bullet points that should be prose?
3. Does it sound like a human wrote it?
4. Is the ask/conclusion clear?
5. Would Dmitrii actually say this out loud?

---

**Blog 3:** "Where AI Agents Meet On-Chain Execution" (2024-12-01)
- Opens with perspective: "After years building infrastructure..."
- Uses clear headings but flows naturally between ideas
- Domain-specific language (smart contracts, escrow, slashing) without over-explanation
- Ends with engagement: "Building here? Let's connect."

**Blog 4:** "The Hidden Complexity of ETF-Grade Staking" (2024-11-15)
- Opens with demystification: "ETH staking sounds straightforward... Entirely different beast."
- Shows tension/paradox clearly: "These requirements conflict."
- Uses structured but readable format for technical content
- Shares real decision-making perspective: "We chose in-house..."

---

### For Social Media Content

Based on the style guide and blog examples, here are the key principles for social media:

1. **Lead with substance** - Don't bury the point
2. **Use natural language** - Sound conversational, like you're speaking to someone
3. **Show, don't tell** - Include specific examples or real situations
4. **Direct and clear** - No fluff or hedging
5. **Domain expertise** - Talk confidently about Web3, AI, and product management
6. **Problem-focused** - Frame around real challenges and solutions
7. **Personal but not oversharing** - Share perspective without being effusive
8. **Active voice** - "I built" not "was built by me"

The writing style is distinctly human, thoughtful, and builds credibility through concrete examples rather than self-promotion.

    87→## Part III: Agent Governance
    88→
    89→> **ATTENTION ALL AI AGENTS**: These rules are mandatory.
    90→
    91→### 3.1 Session Logging — MANDATORY
    92→
    93→At **end of every session**, update Part VI (Session Log) with:
    94→- Summary (1-2 sentences)
    95→- Key changes (bullet list)
    96→- Files changed
    97→- Next actions
    98→
    99→### 3.2 Design System First
   100→
   101→> "If it isn't in the Design System, it doesn't exist."
   102→
   103→| Rule | Description |
   104→|------|-------------|
   105→| Single Source | `context/DESIGN.md` + `src/styles/globals.css` |
   106→| No Snowflakes | NEVER hardcode colors/pixels — use CSS variables |
   107→| Theme Parity | Every change MUST work in Dark AND Light mode |
   108→
   109→### 3.3 Git Workflow
   110→
   111→| Rule | Description |
   112→|------|-------------|
   113→| Branch Protection | `main` is PROTECTED — no direct pushes |
   114→| Feature Branches | Create descriptive branches |
   115→| Pull Requests | Use `gh pr create`, squash merge |
   116→
   117→### 3.4 Before Finalizing UI Work
   118→
   119→- [ ] Used CSS variables from `globals.css`?
   120→- [ ] No hardcoded hex colors or pixels?
   121→- [ ] Tested in both Dark AND Light mode?
   122→- [ ] Mobile responsive?
   123→

   151→## Part V: Capstone Quality Pipeline
   152→
   153→### Overview
   154→
   155→YAML is canonical. JSON is derived. Every claim must be traceable.
   156→
   157→```
   158→Knowledge Base → Variant YAML → sync → JSON → eval → redteam → Deploy
   159→```
   160→
   161→### Commands
   162→
   163→```bash
   164→npm run variants:sync              # YAML→JSON
   165→npm run eval:variant -- --slug X   # Generate claims ledger
   166→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug X # Adversarial scan
   167→npm run ucv-cli                    # Interactive dashboard
   168→```
   169→
   170→### Quality Gates
   171→
   172→| Check | Catches |
   173→|-------|---------|
   174→| `RT-SEC-SECRETS` | API keys, tokens |
   175→| `RT-SEC-CONFIDENTIAL` | NDA language |
   176→| `RT-TONE-SYCOPHANCY` | "thrilled", "dream company" |
   177→| `RT-XVAR-CONTAM` | Mentions other target company |

   190→## Part VI: Session Log
   191→
   192→### Quick Reference (Patterns to Remember)
   193→
   194→| Pattern | Implementation |
   195→|---------|----------------|
   196→| Markdown links in highlights | `[Product](url)` renders as accent-colored links |
   197→| SMART bullets | 3-4 per role: `[Action] + [What] + [Metric] + [Context]` |
   198→| Schema-first workflow | Read `src/lib/schemas.ts` before writing content |
   199→
   200→### Content Locations

   115→```
   116→
   117→### Key Patterns
   118→
   119→1. **Inline Styles with CSS Variables**: Components use inline `style` props with CSS variables
   120→   ```tsx
   121→   style={{ color: 'var(--color-text-primary)' }}
   122→   ```
   123→
   124→2. **Theme via data-attribute**: Theme switching uses `data-theme` on `<html>`
   125→   ```css
   126→   [data-theme="light"] { --color-background: #fafafa; }
   127→   ```
   128→
   129→3. **ThemeContext**: Provides `isDark`, `toggleTheme`, `theme` - but NOT colors (deprecated)
   130→
   131→4. **Universal CV - Variant System**: Portfolio personalization for job applications
   132→   - Base profile + variant overrides = personalized experience
   133→   - Dynamic routes via HashRouter (`/#/:company/:role`)
   134→   - VariantContext provides merged profile to components
   135→   - Sections receive `profile` prop from context (not direct imports)
   136→
   137→---
   138→
   139→## Universal CV System
   140→
   141→### Overview
   142→
   143→The Universal CV system creates personalized portfolio variants tailored to specific job applications using AI-generated overrides of the base profile.
   144→
   145→**Live Examples:**
   146→- Base: `https://edgeoftrust.com/#/`
   147→- Bloomberg TPM: `https://edgeoftrust.com/#/bloomberg/technical-product-manager`
   148→- Gensyn TPM: `https://edgeoftrust.com/#/gensyn/technical-product-manager`
   149→
   150→### Architecture
   151→
   152→**Data Flow:**
   153→```
   154→URL (/#/company/role)
   155→  → React Router captures params
   156→  → VariantPortfolio.tsx loads variant JSON
   157→  → variants.ts: mergeProfile(base + overrides)
   158→  → VariantContext provides merged profile
   159→  → Portfolio.tsx receives from context
   160→  → Sections (Hero, About, etc.) receive profile prop
   161→  → Personalized content rendered
   162→```
   163→
   164→**Key Files:**
   165→- `src/context/VariantContext.tsx` - Profile injection system
   166→- `src/pages/VariantPortfolio.tsx` - Dynamic variant loader
   167→- `src/lib/variants.ts` - Loading + merging logic
   168→- `src/types/variant.ts` - Type definitions
   169→- `scripts/generate-cv.ts` - CLI generator (243 lines)
   170→- `content/variants/*.{yaml,json}` - Variant data
   171→
   172→### Variant Schema
   173→
   174→```typescript
   175→interface Variant {
   176→  metadata: {
   177→    company: string;
   178→    role: string;
   179→    slug: string;
   180→    generatedAt: string;
   181→    jobDescription: string;
   182→    generationModel?: string;
   183→  };
   184→  overrides: {
   185→    hero?: {
   186→      status?: string;
   187→      headline?: HeadlineSegment[];
   188→      subheadline?: string;
   189→    };
   190→    about?: {
   191→      tagline?: string;
   192→      bio?: string[];
   193→      stats?: Stat[];
   194→    };
   195→    sections?: {
   196→      beyondWork?: boolean;
   197→      blog?: boolean;
   198→      onchainIdentity?: boolean;
   199→      skills?: boolean;
   200→      passionProjects?: boolean;
   201→    };
   202→  };
   203→  relevance?: {
   204→    caseStudies?: Array<{ slug: string; relevanceScore: number; reasoning?: string }>;
   205→    skills?: Array<{ category: string; relevanceScore: number }>;
   206→    projects?: Array<{ slug: string; relevanceScore: number; reasoning?: string }>;
   207→  };
   208→}
   209→```
   210→
   211→### Creating Variants
   212→
   213→**CLI Generator:**
   214→```bash
   215→npm run generate:cv -- \
   216→  --company "Company" \
   217→  --role "Role Title" \
   218→  --jd "./job-description.txt" \
   219→  --provider gemini
   220→```
   221→
   222→**Supported Providers:**
   223→- Claude (Anthropic): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   224→- OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   225→- Gemini (Google): `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   226→
   227→### Component Integration
   228→
   229→**IMPORTANT**: Sections that show personalized content MUST receive `profile` as a prop:
   230→
   231→```tsx
   232→// ✅ CORRECT - Receives profile from context
   233→function HeroSection({ profile, isMobile }: { profile: Profile; isMobile: boolean }) {
   234→  const { hero } = profile;  // Uses variant profile
   235→  // ...
   236→}
   237→
   238→// ❌ INCORRECT - Direct import bypasses variants
   239→import { profile } from '../lib/content';
   240→function HeroSection({ isMobile }: { isMobile: boolean }) {
   241→  const { hero } = profile;  // Always uses base profile!
   242→  // ...
   243→}
   244→```
   245→
   246→**Updated Components:**
   247→- `HeroSection.tsx` - Receives `profile` prop
   248→- `AboutSection.tsx` - Receives `profile` prop
   249→- `CertificationsSection.tsx` - Receives `profile` prop
   250→
   251→**In Portfolio.tsx:**
   252→```tsx
   253→const { profile } = useVariant();  // Get from context
   254→
   255→<HeroSection profile={profile} isMobile={isMobile} ... />
   256→<AboutSection profile={profile} isMobile={isMobile} ... />
   257→```
   258→
   259→### Routing
   260→
   261→**HashRouter** (GitHub Pages compatible):
   262→```tsx
   263→// src/App.tsx
   264→<HashRouter>
   265→  <Routes>
   266→    <Route path="/" element={<BasePortfolio />} />
   267→    <Route path="/:company/:role" element={<VariantPortfolio />} />
   268→  </Routes>
   269→</HashRouter>
   270→```
   271→
   272→**Why Hash Routing?**
   273→- GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side redirects
   274→- Hash URLs (`/#/company/role`) handled client-side
   275→- Fully shareable and bookmarkable
   276→- Can switch to BrowserRouter on Vercel/Netlify with proper config
   277→
   278→### Build Process
   279→
   280→Variants are bundled as separate chunks for optimal loading:
   281→```
   282→dist/assets/
   283→├── bloomberg-technical-product-manager-[hash].js  (4KB)
   284→├── gensyn-technical-product-manager-[hash].js     (4KB)
   285→└── index-[hash].js                                (main bundle)
   286→```
   287→
   288→Vite's `import.meta.glob` enables lazy loading:
   289→```typescript
   290→const variantFiles = import.meta.glob('../../content/variants/*.json', {
   291→  eager: false  // Lazy load only when needed
   292→});
   293→```
   294→
   295→---
   296→
   297→## Capstone Quality Pipeline (NEW)
   298→
   299→The capstone project wraps the Universal CV system with production-grade AI product evaluation.
   300→
   301→### Core Concept
   302→
   303→```
   304→YAML is canonical → JSON is derived
   305→Facts live in knowledge base → Variants reference them
   306→Every claim must be traceable → Machine-checkable ledger
   307→```
   308→
   309→### Quality Scripts
   310→
   311→| Script | Purpose | Command |
   312→|--------|---------|---------|
   313→| `sync-variants.ts` | YAML→JSON sync | `npm run variants:sync` |
   314→| `evaluate-variants.ts` | Generate claims ledger | `npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug>` |
   315→| `redteam.ts` | Adversarial scanning | `npm run redteam:variant -- --slug <slug>` |
   316→
   317→### Build Integration
   318→
   319→```json
   320→"predev": "npm run variants:sync",
   321→"prebuild": "npm run validate && npm run variants:sync"
   322→```
   323→
   324→Every `npm run dev` and `npm run build` now enforces YAML/JSON parity.
   325→
   326→### Knowledge Base
   327→
   328→```
   329→content/knowledge/
   330→├── index.yaml           # Entity graph
   331→├── achievements/        # STAR-format: Situation, Task, Action, Result
   332→│   ├── ankr-15x-revenue.yaml
   333→│   ├── eth-staking-zero-slashing.yaml
   334→│   └── ...
   335→└── stories/             # Extended narratives
   336→```
   337→
   338→**Golden Rule**: Fix facts in the knowledge base, not in the variant output.
   339→
   340→### Claims Ledger
   341→
   342→For each variant, the evaluation script extracts metric-like claims and generates:
   343→- `capstone/develop/evals/<slug>.claims.yaml` — Machine-checkable
   344→- `capstone/develop/evals/<slug>.eval.md` — Human checklist
   345→
   346→```bash
   347→npm run eval:variant -- --slug bloomberg-technical-product-manager
   348→npm run eval:check  # Fails if unverified claims
   349→```
   350→
   351→### Red Team Checks
   352→
   353→| Check ID | Catches |
   354→|----------|---------|
   355→| `RT-SEC-SECRETS` | API keys, tokens |
   356→| `RT-SEC-CONFIDENTIAL` | NDA language |
   357→| `RT-TONE-SYCOPHANCY` | "thrilled", "dream company" |
   358→| `RT-ACC-INFLATION` | "about 15×" near metrics |
   359→| `RT-XVAR-CONTAM` | Mentions other target company |
   360→
   361→```bash
   362→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug bloomberg-technical-product-manager
   363→npm run redteam:check --strict  # WARN = FAIL
   364→```
   365→
   366→### PM Workflow
   367→
   368→Work one variant at a time through the pipeline:
   369→1. `npm run variants:sync`
   370→2. `npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug>`
   371→3. Verify claims in `*.claims.yaml`
   372→4. `npm run eval:check`
   373→5. `npm run redteam:variant -- --slug <slug>`
   374→6. `npm run redteam:check`
   375→7. Fix KB or variant wording until clean
   376→8. Commit + deploy
   377→

   422→## Recent Work (Dec 2024)
   423→
   424→### Design System Migration
   425→
   426→**Objective**: Migrate from React context-based colors to CSS custom properties
   427→
   428→**Changes Made:**
   429→1. Created `src/styles/globals.css` with all design tokens
   430→2. Updated `ThemeContext.tsx` to set `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`
   431→3. Migrated 8 components to use CSS variables instead of `useTheme().colors`:
   432→   - ThemeToggle.tsx
   433→   - FooterSection.tsx
   434→   - HeroSection.tsx
   435→   - AboutSection.tsx
   436→   - SocialSection.tsx
   437→   - ExperienceSection.tsx
   438→   - CertificationsSection.tsx
   439→   - CaseStudyModal.tsx
   440→
   441→**Git Commits:**
   442→- `34a925e` - feat: migrate design system to CSS custom properties
   443→- `1d5668e` - test: add design system test suite with Vitest
   444→
   445→---
   446→
   447→## Important Conventions
   448→
   449→### DO ✅
   450→
   451→- Use CSS variables for all colors: `var(--color-*)`
   452→- Use spacing tokens: `var(--space-md)` not `16px`
   453→- Use font variables: `var(--font-serif)` not hardcoded strings
   454→- Run `npm run test:design-system` after design changes
   455→
   456→### DON'T ❌
   457→
   458→- Import `colors` from `useTheme()` - this is deprecated
   459→- Use hardcoded hex colors in components
   460→- Use `isDark` conditionals for colors (CSS handles this now)
   461→
   462→---
   463→
   464→## Dependencies
   465→
   466→**Core:**
   467→- react@19.2.0
   468→- react-dom@19.2.0

     3→date: "2024-12-22"
     4→excerpt: "How a career transition led to building an AI-powered portfolio system—combining Web3 experience, an AI PM certification capstone, and a lot of late nights."
     5→tags: ["Career", "AI", "Portfolio", "Capstone"]
     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Found myself between roles. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*
    10→
    11→I knew two things: I wanted to stay at the intersection of Web3 and AI, and I needed a better way to present my work. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. LinkedIn felt like shouting into the void.
    12→
    13→So I started building.
    14→
    15→## From Resume to Portfolio
    16→
    17→First version was just a static page. More resume than portfolio—bullet points, job titles, the usual. It worked, but it didn't *differentiate*.
    18→
    19→I needed a brand. Something that captured what I actually do: build trust infrastructure at the edge of new technology. "Edge of Trust" stuck.
    20→
    21→The portfolio evolved. Case studies instead of bullet points. Real metrics instead of vague impact claims. A design system that didn't look like every other developer portfolio.
    22→
    23→But I wanted more.
    24→
    25→## The Capstone Connection
    26→
    27→While building the portfolio, I was taking the [AI Product Management Certification](https://maven.com/product-faculty/ai-product-management-certification) from Product Faculty. The course teaches a 4D approach to building AI features: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.
    28→
    29→The certification requires a capstone project. Most people build something separate. I thought: why not combine them?
    30→
    31→What if the portfolio itself was the capstone? What if I built an AI-powered system that could generate targeted portfolio variants for specific job applications?
    32→
    33→That's how Universal CV was born.
    34→
    35→## What Universal CV Actually Is
    36→
    37→The core idea is simple: create targeted portfolio pages that are accurate without embellishment, tailored to specific roles based on my actual experience data and the job description I'm applying for.
    38→
    39→The system has three parts:
    40→
    41→**1. Knowledge Base**
    42→All my achievements, metrics, and stories stored in structured YAML. Every claim traceable to a source. No hallucination possible because the AI can only surface what's already documented.
    43→
    44→**2. Variant Engine**
    45→Takes a job description, matches it against my knowledge base, and generates a customized portfolio variant. Different emphasis for different roles—infrastructure PM vs. developer tools PM vs. Web3 PM.
    46→
    47→**3. Quality Pipeline**
    48→This is where it gets interesting. I built an eval and red-teaming harness:
    49→
    50→```
    51→Knowledge Base → Variant YAML → Sync → Eval → Red Team → Deploy
    52→```
    53→
    54→The eval step extracts every claim and finds candidate sources. The red team step scans for:
    55→- Sycophantic language ("thrilled to apply")
    56→- Unverified metrics
    57→- Cross-variant contamination (mentioning wrong company)
    58→- Confidential information leaks
    59→
    60→If a variant doesn't pass the gates, it doesn't ship.
    61→
    62→## Why This Matters
    63→
    64→Most AI-generated content has a trust problem. It sounds plausible but might be fabricated. For a portfolio—where your professional reputation is on the line—that's unacceptable.
    65→
    66→Universal CV inverts the approach. Instead of generating content and hoping it's accurate, it:
    67→1. Starts with verified source data
    68→2. Constrains generation to that data
    69→3. Evaluates every claim against sources
    70→4. Red-teams for tone and accuracy issues
    71→
    72→The AI assists with targeting and presentation. The facts come from me.
    73→
    74→## What I've Built So Far
    75→
    76→- Portfolio site with 4 case studies, 3 blog posts, full design system
    77→- Variant engine supporting 5 targeted variants
    78→- Claims evaluation pipeline with source matching
    79→- Red team scanner with 8+ automated checks
    80→- Interactive CLI dashboard (`npm run ucv-cli`) for managing the whole flow
    81→
    82→## What's Next
    83→
    84→Still working on the evaluation flow. The harness is built, but I want to run proper experiments:
    85→- How well does variant targeting match JD requirements?
    86→- What's the false negative rate on the red team checks?
    87→- Can I automate more of the claim verification?
    88→
    89→Goal is to open-source this once the capstone is complete. Job searching sucks. Maybe this helps someone else.
    90→
    91→## The Real Outcome
    92→
    93→At the end of this, I'll have:
    94→
    95→1. **A professional-grade portfolio** — Not a template, a system
    96→2. **Universal CV engine** — AI-powered variant generation with quality gates
    97→3. **Deep understanding of AI evaluation** — Not just theory, hands-on implementation
    98→
    99→Career transitions create space. This one let me build something I wouldn't have built otherwise.
   100→

     2→title: "The Hidden Complexity of ETF-Grade Staking"
     3→date: "2024-11-15"
     4→excerpt: "What it really takes to build staking infrastructure for institutional clients—the compliance, custody, and coordination challenges nobody talks about."
     5→tags: ["Staking", "Ethereum", "Custody", "Institutional"]
     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→"ETH staking" sounds straightforward: deposit 32 ETH, run a validator, earn yield. Building staking infrastructure for institutional clients like ETF providers? Entirely different beast.
    10→
    11→## The Custody Paradox
    12→
    13→Institutional staking creates a fundamental tension.
    14→
    15→**For maximum yield**, you want:
    16→- Distributed validator infrastructure
    17→- Quick slashing response
    18→- Flexible withdrawal strategies
    19→- MEV optimization
    20→
    21→**For custody compliance**, you need:
    22→- Full control of withdrawal keys
    23→- Auditable key management
    24→- Regulatory-approved processes
    25→- Cold storage capabilities
    26→
    27→These requirements conflict. Distributed architecture optimizes uptime but creates custody concerns. Cold storage satisfies auditors but slows response times.
    28→
    29→## Key Decisions We Faced
    30→
    31→### 1. In-House vs. Staking-as-a-Service
    32→
    33→This was our biggest decision. Third-party staking providers offered:
    34→- Faster time-to-market
    35→- Battle-tested infrastructure
    36→- Less operational burden
    37→
    38→But in-house infrastructure gave us:
    39→- Full custody key control
    40→- Regulatory defensibility
    41→- Custom compliance integration
    42→- Better margins long-term
    43→
    44→We chose in-house. For ETF-grade custody, there's no substitute for full key ownership.
    45→
    46→### 2. Validator Client Diversity
    47→
    48→Ethereum's decentralization depends on running diverse validator clients. But diversity creates operational complexity:
    49→
    50→```
    51→Our approach:
    52→├── Primary: Lighthouse (40%)
    53→├── Secondary: Prysm (30%)
    54→├── Tertiary: Teku (20%)
    55→└── Fallback: Nimbus (10%)
    56→```
    57→
    58→Each client has different:
    59→- Resource requirements
    60→- Slashing DB formats
    61→- API interfaces
    62→- Upgrade schedules
    63→
    64→Managing this diversity while maintaining consistent SLAs is a product challenge in itself.
    65→
    66→### 3. Slashing Prevention
    67→
    68→A single slashing event could cost millions and destroy institutional trust. Our prevention strategy:
    69→
    70→1. **Web3Signer** — Air-gapped signing with slashing protection
    71→2. **Redundant slashing DBs** — Multiple sources of truth
    72→3. **Alert systems** — Sub-second detection of potential issues
    73→4. **Graceful degradation** — Better to miss a few attestations than risk slashing
    74→
    75→## The Coordination Problem
    76→
    77→Institutional staking isn't just a technical challenge—it's a coordination challenge across:
    78→
    79→- **Engineering**: Building reliable infrastructure
    80→- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements
    81→- **Legal**: Structuring agreements properly
    82→- **Clients**: Managing expectations and communication
    83→- **Regulators**: Staying ahead of evolving guidance
    84→
    85→As a PM, my job is often to be the translator between these groups, ensuring technical decisions account for compliance constraints and vice versa.
    86→
    87→## Lessons Learned
    88→
    89→**Start with compliance, not features.** Doesn't matter how good your yield is if you can't pass an audit.
    90→
    91→**Institutional clients want boring.** They don't want the best APY. They want predictable, auditable, defensible infrastructure.
    92→
    93→**The moat is trust.** Anyone can run validators. Not everyone can do it with the paper trail institutions require.
    94→
    95→**Document everything.** Every decision, every trade-off, every incident response. Invaluable during audits and client reviews.
    96→
    97→## Looking Ahead
    98→
    99→The ETH staking market is still early. As more ETFs come online and institutions get comfortable with crypto, the opportunity is massive. But winning requires a different playbook than consumer crypto—one built on compliance, reliability, and trust.

     7→---
     8→
     9→After years building infrastructure for institutional crypto custody, I'm convinced the next wave of crypto adoption won't come from retail traders or traditional institutions. It'll come from AI agents.
    10→
    11→## The Problem with Today's AI Agents
    12→
    13→AI agents are powerful at reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks. But they have a critical limitation: **they can't hold value or make credible commitments**.
    14→
    15→When an AI agent promises to do something in exchange for payment, there's no enforcement mechanism. The agent can't:
    16→- Hold funds in escrow
    17→- Post collateral
    18→- Be slashed for misbehavior
    19→- Participate in trustless coordination
    20→
    21→On-chain execution solves this.
    22→
    23→## Smart Contracts as Agent Infrastructure
    24→
    25→Smart contracts provide exactly what AI agents need:
    26→
    27→1. **Programmable escrow** — Funds are held until conditions are met
    28→2. **Verifiable commitments** — Actions are transparent and auditable
    29→3. **Trustless coordination** — Multiple agents can collaborate without trusting each other
    30→4. **Economic incentives** — Stake, slash, and reward mechanisms align behavior
    31→
    32→```solidity
    33→// Example: Simple agent task escrow
    34→contract AgentTask {
    35→    address public requester;
    36→    address public agent;
    37→    uint256 public reward;
    38→    bytes32 public taskHash;
    39→    
    40→    function completeTask(bytes calldata proof) external {
    41→        require(msg.sender == agent);
    42→        require(verifyProof(proof, taskHash));
    43→        payable(agent).transfer(reward);
    44→    }
    45→}
    46→```
    47→
    48→## What I'm Watching
    49→
    50→A few developments that excite me:
    51→
    52→**Agent-to-agent payments**: Services like OpenAI's function calling combined with crypto payments could enable agents to hire other agents. Imagine an AI that can spin up compute, pay for API calls, and coordinate with specialized agents—all autonomously.
    53→
    54→**MPC for agent wallets**: The same MPC infrastructure we built for institutional custody could power agent wallets. Agents could control keys without any single party having full access.
    55→
    56→**On-chain reputation**: As agents accumulate history on-chain, we'll see emergence of agent credit scores and reputation systems.
    57→
    58→## The PM Perspective
    59→
    60→This space inverts traditional UX design. We're not designing for humans—we're designing for:
    61→
    62→- **Deterministic execution** over intuitive interfaces
    63→- **API-first** over UI-first
    64→- **Composability** over integration
    65→- **Auditability** over privacy (in many cases)
    66→
    67→The primitives are different from human-centric crypto products. That's what makes it interesting.
    68→
    69→---

     2→title: "Why Content Validation Matters for Developer Portfolios"
     3→date: "2024-12-15"
     4→excerpt: "Building a portfolio is easy. Maintaining content quality at scale is hard. Here's how automated validation saves time and prevents embarrassing mistakes."
     5→tags: ["Developer Tools", "Best Practices", "Automation"]
     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Too many portfolios with broken links, malformed YAML, inconsistent data structures. The solution isn't "be more careful"—it's automation.
    10→
    11→## The Problem with Manual Validation
    12→
    13→When you're managing a portfolio with multiple content types (case studies, blog posts, projects), manual checking doesn't scale:
    14→
    15→**Common mistakes:**
    16→- Typos in YAML keys (`compnay` instead of `company`)
    17→- Wrong date formats (`12/15/2024` vs. `2024-12-15`)
    18→- Missing required fields that crash builds
    19→- Duplicate IDs between case studies
    20→- Invalid URLs that go unnoticed
    21→
    22→These errors often don't surface until:
    23→1. Your build fails in CI/CD
    24→2. A recruiter clicks a broken link
    25→3. Your case study drawer shows `undefined`
    26→
    27→By then, it's too late.
    28→
    29→## The Solution: Schema Validation
    30→
    31→The answer is **Zod schemas** combined with a validation CLI.
    32→
    33→### What This Looks Like
    34→
    35→```typescript
    36→// Define your schema once
    37→const CaseStudySchema = z.object({
    38→  id: z.number(),
    39→  title: z.string(),
    40→  year: z.string(),
    41→  // ... all your fields
    42→});
    43→
    44→// Validate before commit
    45→validateFile(caseStudy, CaseStudySchema);
    46→```
    47→
    48→### Benefits
    49→
    50→1. **Catch errors early** - Before they reach production
    51→2. **Self-documenting** - Schema is your source of truth
    52→3. **Type safety** - TypeScript types derived from schemas
    53→4. **Fast feedback** - Run validation in <1 second
    54→5. **CI/CD integration** - Block bad commits automatically
    55→
    56→## Real-World Example
    57→
    58→Here's what validation caught in my portfolio:
    59→
    60→```bash
    61→npm run validate
    62→
    63→✗ Case Study: 05-new-project.md
    64→  ✗ hook.impactMetric.value: Required
    65→  ✗ year: Expected YYYY or YYYY-YY format
    66→  ✗ cta.action: Invalid enum value
    67→```
    68→
    69→Without validation, these would have crashed my build or shown broken UI.
    70→
    71→## Implementation
    72→
    73→**1. Define schemas:**
    74→```typescript
    75→export const CaseStudySchema = z.object({
    76→  id: z.number(),
    77→  slug: z.string(),
    78→  title: z.string(),
    79→  company: z.string(),
    80→  year: z.string(),
    81→  // ...
    82→});
    83→```
    84→
    85→**2. Create validation script:**
    86→```typescript
    87→function validateContent() {
    88→  const files = readAllContent();
    89→  files.forEach(file => {
    90→    const result = schema.safeParse(file);
    91→    if (!result.success) {
    92→      console.error(result.error);
    93→      process.exit(1);
    94→    }
    95→  });
    96→}
    97→```
    98→
    99→**3. Add to package.json:**
   100→```json
   101→{
   102→  "scripts": {
   103→    "validate": "tsx scripts/validate-content.ts"
   104→  }
   105→}
   106→```
   107→
   108→**4. Run before commits:**
   109→```bash
   110→npm run validate
   111→git commit -m "Add new case study"
   112→```
   113→
   114→## Beyond Portfolios
   115→
   116→This pattern works for any content-driven application:
   117→- Documentation sites
   118→- Blog platforms
   119→- Product catalogs
   120→- Configuration management
   121→
   122→The key insight: **treat content as code**.
   123→
   124→## Key Takeaways
   125→
   126→- **Validation is infrastructure** — Not optional, foundational
   127→- **Fail fast** — Catch errors locally, not in production
   128→- **Automate everything** — Manual checks don't scale
   129→- **Use types** — Schemas + TypeScript = confidence
   130→
   131→## Next Steps
   132→
   133→If you're maintaining a content-heavy portfolio:
   134→
   135→1. Add Zod
   136→2. Define schemas for each content type
   137→3. Write validation script
   138→4. Run validation in CI/CD
   139→5. Create templates with correct structure
   140→
   141→Your future self will thank you when the CLI catches a missing field before a recruiter sees a broken page.
   142→

```
     1→---
     2→name: dmitrii-writing-style
     3→description: Captures Dmitrii's distinctive writing voice and preferences for all written outputs. Use when creating case studies, blog posts, articles, documents, emails, proposals, PRDs, specifications, messages, or any written content on Dmitrii's behalf. MUST be invoked for any mid-to-long form content creation.
     4→---
     5→
     6→# Dmitrii's Writing Style
     7→
     8→## When Claude MUST Use This Skill
     9→
    10→**Always invoke this skill when:**
    11→- Creating case studies or portfolio content
    12→- Writing blog posts or articles
    13→- Generating any mid-to-long form content (500+ words)
    14→- Drafting proposals, PRDs, or specifications
    15→- Composing emails or professional correspondence
    16→- Creating any written output on Dmitrii's behalf
    17→
    18→This skill is mandatory for content creation tasks—not optional.
    19→
    20→## Core Voice Characteristics
    21→
    22→**Direct and Action-Oriented**: Get to the point. Lead with the substance. Dmitrii values clarity over elaborate setups.
    23→
    24→**Warm but Professional**: Friendly tone without being informal. Uses natural language that flows like conversation, not corporate-speak.
    25→
    26→**Intellectually Curious**: Willing to probe deeper, ask "why," and challenge surface-level answers. Not afraid to admit uncertainty ("it feels that this is a bit over my head").
    27→
    28→**Practical Problem-Solver**: Always oriented toward what can be built, shipped, or acted upon.
    29→
    30→## Formatting Preferences
    31→
    32→### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
    33→- Bullet points in emails or conversational contexts
    34→- Excessive bold/headers in short communications
    35→- Numbered lists unless truly sequential steps
    36→- HTML tags in copy-paste contexts (no `<br>`, etc.)
    37→- Robotic or overly formal phrasing
    38→- Generic corporate language
    39→
    40→### Preferred Patterns
    41→- **Flowing prose** in emails and messages—ideas connected with natural transitions
    42→- **Tables** for structured comparisons in documents (pricing, features, deliverables)
    43→- **Clear hierarchy** in technical docs, but minimal in casual communication
    44→- **One request per sentence** in emails—compound requests broken naturally
    45→
    46→### When Structure IS Appropriate
    47→- PRDs and specifications (MoSCoW tables, JTBD frameworks)
    48→- Technical documentation (synopses, arguments, examples)
    49→- Proposals with clear deliverables and pricing
    50→- Research prompts with explicit constraints
    51→
    52→## Writing by Context
    53→
    54→### Emails & Messages
    55→- Single flowing paragraph for simple requests
    56→- No bullet points unless truly listing items (shopping list, etc.)
    57→- Warm opening without being effusive ("Hi [Name]," not "Dear Esteemed...")
    58→- Close with clear next step
    59→- If multiple points, weave them into prose
    60→
    61→**Example transformation:**
    62→```
    63→Bad:  Please:
    64→      1. Update the system
    65→      2. Forward to Mike
    66→      3. Let me know if questions
    67→
    68→Good: Could you please update the system with the attached and forward it to Mike? Let me know if you have any questions.
    69→```
    70→
    71→### Proposals & Business Documents
    72→- Lead with clear objective
    73→- Deliverables in tables or structured sections
    74→- Pricing direct and unambiguous
    75→- Next steps as concrete actions
    76→- Professional but not stiff
    77→
    78→### PRDs & Technical Specifications
    79→- Use frameworks when appropriate (MoSCoW, JTBD, user stories)
    80→- Clear sections with logical hierarchy
    81→- Tables for prioritization matrices
    82→- Explicit scope boundaries ("Won't" items)
    83→- Technical depth where warranted
    84→
    85→### Research Prompts & Instructions
    86→- Explicit scope constraints (geography, timeframe, audience)
    87→- Structured output format requirements
    88→- Clear evaluation criteria
    89→- Instruction to "not soften conclusions"
    90→- Prefer truth over excitement
    91→
    92→### Reflective & Philosophical Writing
    93→- Deep engagement without pretension
    94→- Probing questions to push past surface answers
    95→- Comfort with uncertainty and ambiguity
    96→- Uses analogies and thought experiments naturally
    97→- Willing to sit with paradox
    98→
    99→## Vocabulary & Phrasing
   100→
   101→### Prefer
   102→- "scope out" over "define"
   103→- "crisp and clear" over "concise"
   104→- "flows well" over "is readable"
   105→- "makes sense" over "is logical"
   106→- "up my alley" over "aligned with my interests"
   107→- "crack [a problem]" over "solve"
   108→- Active voice throughout
   109→
   110→### Avoid
   111→- Jargon for its own sake
   112→- Hedging language when confidence is warranted
   113→- Apologetic qualifiers ("just," "maybe," "I think perhaps...")
   114→- Filler phrases ("In order to," "It should be noted that...")
   115→
   116→## Domain Voice
   117→
   118→Dmitrii operates at the intersection of:
   119→- **Web3/Blockchain**: Comfortable with protocol terminology, tokenomics, on-chain concepts
   120→- **Product Management**: JTBD, MoSCoW, user stories, roadmaps
   121→- **Institutional Compliance**: KYC/AML, regulatory frameworks, audit requirements
   122→- **AI/Agents**: Agent identity, attestation, autonomy
   123→
   124→When writing in these domains, use precise terminology without over-explaining basics—assume technical competence in the reader.
   125→
   126→## Quality Checks
   127→
   128→Before finalizing any writing, verify:
   129→1. Could this be said more directly?
   130→2. Are there bullet points that should be prose?
   131→3. Does it sound like a human wrote it?
   132→4. Is the ask/conclusion clear?
   133→5. Would Dmitrii actually say this out loud?
   134→

    36→---
    37→
    38→Liquidations, governance votes, whale movements—every major on-chain event was invisible until it was too late. Traders missed opportunities. Protocols couldn't react fast enough. Communities were always behind.
    39→
    40→## The Challenge
    41→
    42→Blockchains are transparent, but staying ahead of critical events required complex custom setups, constant polling, or expensive infrastructure. No simple way to get real-time notifications about what's happening on-chain.
    43→
    44→The constraints:
    45→- Bootstrapping solo with limited resources
    46→- Multiple chains needed (Ethereum, Cosmos ecosystem)
    47→- Sub-second latency or it's worthless—alerts after the fact are just news
    48→- Developer SDK simple enough for quick integration
    49→
    50→## The Approach
    51→
    52→The bet: a scenario-based alerting platform with no-code configuration. Make tracking whale wallets as easy as setting up a Google Alert.
    53→
    54→### Alternatives Considered
    55→
    56→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    57→|--------|------------|---------|
    58→| Build for enterprise only | Higher contract values, clearer monetization | Long sales cycles, needed traction fast |
    59→| Developer-only API | Simpler product, focused use case | Missed larger opportunity in no-code market |
    60→| Single chain focus | Faster development, deeper integration | Multi-chain was the clear direction of the ecosystem |
    61→
    62→We built both: no-code consumer platform AND developer SDK. Started with Cosmos where competition was thinner.
    63→
    64→## Key Decision
    65→
    66→**Launching as default alerting provider on Archway mainnet**
    67→
    68→Archway (Cosmos SDK L1) was launching their mainnet. I pitched Mempools as their official alerting infrastructure.
    69→
    70→Launched Archway-Alerts.com the same day as their mainnet. Became the default platform for the ecosystem.
    71→
    72→> Instead of competing for developers, we became the recommended solution. One partnership gave us instant distribution and credibility.
    73→
    74→## Execution
    75→
    76→### Phase 1: Core Platform (8 weeks)
    77→- Real-time event monitoring infrastructure on Ethereum
    78→- Scenario builder with AND/OR logic for complex alerts
    79→- Multi-channel delivery: Telegram, Discord, webhooks, email
    80→
    81→### Phase 2: SDK Development (4 weeks)
    82→- Published mempools-sdk to NPM
    83→- Documentation and quickstart guides
    84→- Embeddable UI templates for white-label deployments
    85→
    86→### Phase 3: Cosmos Expansion (4 weeks)
    87→- Extended to Archway, Juno, and Canto networks
    88→- Chain-specific event parsing for Cosmos transaction types
    89→- Archway-Alerts.com as flagship deployment
    90→
    91→### Phase 4: Partnerships (Ongoing)
    92→- Luganodes partnership for enhanced node infrastructure
    93→- Ecosystem projects onboarded as early adopters
    94→- Community building through Twitter Spaces and Discord
    95→
    96→## Results
    97→
    98→- **200+ Daily Active Users** — Organic growth through ecosystem partnerships
    99→- **Sub-second delivery** — Alerts arriving before users could manually check
   100→- **5 chains supported** — Ethereum, Arbitrum, Archway, Juno, Canto
   101→- **Default Archway provider** — Launched alongside mainnet as official platform
   102→
   103→The platform enabled use cases that weren't possible before: arbitrage bots reacting to on-chain signals, portfolio trackers with instant notifications, governance watchers alerting communities to votes.
   104→
   105→## What I Learned
   106→
   107→**What worked:**
   108→- Ecosystem partnerships over raw marketing—one protocol deal worth 100 Twitter impressions
   109→- No-code interface expanded addressable market beyond developers
   110→- Multi-channel delivery (Telegram/Discord) was table stakes for Web3
   111→- Launching with a chain's mainnet = instant distribution
   112→
   113→**What didn't:**
   114→- Underestimated infrastructure costs for real-time monitoring at scale
   115→- Built too many features initially—should have shipped MVP faster
   116→- Discord community building was slower ROI than direct partnership outreach
   117→- Cross-chain complexity higher than anticipated (each chain has different event formats)
   118→
   119→> First-time founder lesson: distribution beats product. Having Archway recommend us to their ecosystem was more valuable than any feature we could have built.
   120→
   121→If I did it again: even more aggressive on ecosystem partnerships from day 1. In crypto infrastructure, you win through distribution, not features.

    47→
    48→No product-market fit meant the RPC product would get shut down or sold off. Team jobs were on the line.
    49→
    50→## The Challenge
    51→
    52→Ankr's RPC infrastructure was underutilized and treated as a commodity. Competing on price with Infura and Alchemy in the developer segment was a race to the bottom. Needed differentiation and a sustainable business model.
    53→
    54→The constraints:
    55→- 5 engineers total
    56→- Infura and Alchemy owned developer mindshare
    57→- RPC is inherently commoditized—hard to differentiate on features
    58→- Developer segment has high churn and low willingness to pay
    59→
    60→## The Approach
    61→
    62→The bet: blockchain protocols have different needs than individual developers. They need reliable infrastructure for their entire ecosystems, have longer sales cycles but higher LTV, and will pay premium for partnership-level support.
    63→
    64→### Alternatives Considered
    65→
    66→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    67→|--------|------------|---------|
    68→| Double down on developer DX | Large market, existing user base | Couldn't out-Alchemy Alchemy—they had 10x our resources |
    69→| Pivot to enterprise (non-crypto) | Higher contract values | Sales cycle too long for our runway |
    70→| Build specialized APIs | Higher margins, less commoditized | Good complement but not standalone business |
    71→
    72→We pivoted to B2B protocol sales while building Advanced APIs as differentiation. Protocols became our core customer; developers became their users.
    73→
    74→## Key Decision
    75→
    76→**B2B pivot: protocols over developers**
    77→
    78→Team was attached to developer-first identity. Pivot felt like abandoning our roots.
    79→
    80→Shifted primary customer from developers to protocols. Developers became users we served through protocol partnerships.
    81→
    82→> Protocols had 10x LTV of developer accounts. One protocol deal = 100 developer signups in revenue. Unit economics finally worked.
    83→
    84→## Execution
    85→
    86→### Phase 1: Customer Discovery (4 weeks)
    87→- 15+ interviews with blockchain protocol teams about infrastructure pain points
    88→- Key insight: protocols were stitching together multiple providers
    89→- Mapped competitive landscape and pricing for protocol-tier contracts
    90→
    91→### Phase 2: Product Repositioning (3 weeks)
    92→- Pricing redesigned with protocol-tier and SLA guarantees
    93→- Partnership program with dedicated support channels
    94→- Case studies from early protocol conversations
    95→
    96→### Phase 3: Advanced APIs Development (8 weeks)
    97→- Shipped Ankr Advanced APIs (NFT, token, query APIs)
    98→- Ankr.JS SDK for improved developer experience
    99→- Usage analytics dashboard for protocol partners
   100→
   101→### Phase 4: Go-to-Market (Ongoing)
   102→- Outbound sales targeting protocol BD teams
   103→- Content marketing around protocol infrastructure needs
   104→- Referral program where protocols recommended us to their developers
   105→
   106→## Results
   107→
   108→- **15× revenue growth** — From ~$130K to $2M ARR in 8 months
   109→- **$2M ARR in 6 months** — Target that seemed impossible at start
   110→- **1M+ daily API requests** — Usage scaled with protocol partnerships
   111→
   112→Proved B2B model works for infrastructure products. Ankr raised additional funding citing this traction. Team avoided layoffs that hit other crypto companies.
   113→
   114→## What I Learned
   115→
   116→**What worked:**
   117→- Customer interviews revealed insight competitors missed—protocols were underserved
   118→- Protocol partnerships created network effects (their developers became our users)
   119→- Advanced APIs gave us differentiation beyond commodity RPC
   120→- SLA guarantees justified premium pricing developers wouldn't pay
   121→
   122→**What didn't:**
   123→- Priced protocol tier too low initially. Left money on the table with first 3 deals
   124→- Ankr.JS SDK was over-engineered. Developers wanted simple examples, not comprehensive abstraction
   125→- Spent too much time on marketing content that didn't convert. Direct outreach was 10x more effective
   126→
   127→> In infrastructure, your customer isn't always your user. Finding the right customer segment can transform unit economics overnight.
   128→
   129→If I did it again: start outbound sales 4 weeks earlier. We waited for "perfect" product when good-enough product with strong sales motion would have accelerated revenue.

    34→
    35→Royalty disputes with major publishers were costing millions in legal fees and damaging relationships. The $120B gaming industry needed a transparent system that could eliminate disputes and give publishers real-time visibility into their earnings.
    36→
    37→## The Challenge
    38→
    39→Xbox needed a transparent, auditable system for tracking and distributing royalty payments to game publishers. Existing databases couldn't give publishers the auditability they demanded—and disputes over payment accuracy were getting expensive.
    40→
    41→The constraints:
    42→- Xbox-scale transaction volumes (millions of purchases)
    43→- Publishers need real-time visibility into royalty accruals
    44→- Audit trail must be immutable and independently verifiable
    45→- Transaction data can't be exposed to competitors
    46→
    47→## The Approach
    48→
    49→The bet: blockchain gives publishers the immutability and transparency they need, while smart contracts automate complex royalty calculations that were error-prone when done manually.
    50→
    51→### Alternatives Considered
    52→
    53→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    54→|--------|------------|---------|
    55→| Enhanced database with audit logging | Simpler, existing infrastructure | Publishers didn't trust Microsoft-controlled audit logs |
    56→| Public Ethereum mainnet | Maximum transparency, decentralization | Transaction data couldn't be public—competitor intelligence risk. Gas costs prohibitive |
    57→| Hyperledger | Enterprise-ready, permissioned by design | Wanted Ethereum ecosystem for tooling and talent |
    58→
    59→We went with a private Ethereum consortium—permissioned access, Ethereum compatibility for tooling, transaction privacy preserved.
    60→
    61→## Key Decision
    62→
    63→**Private consortium vs. public Ethereum**
    64→
    65→Some stakeholders pushed for public chain for "true decentralization." Publishers were concerned about data exposure.
    66→
    67→Chose private consortium. Gave publishers what they actually needed (independent verification) without exposing competitive data.
    68→
    69→> This pattern became the template for other Microsoft blockchain projects.
    70→
    71→## Execution
    72→
    73→### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (3 months)
    74→- Initial smart contract for basic royalty calculation logic
    75→- Demonstrated to Xbox leadership that blockchain could handle required throughput
    76→- Identified key technical risks: key management, network consensus, data privacy
    77→
    78→### Phase 2: Infrastructure Build (6 months)
    79→- Docker/Kubernetes architecture for blockchain consortium nodes
    80→- Deployment automation for multi-node Ethereum network on Azure
    81→- Key management system integrated with Azure Key Vault
    82→
    83→### Phase 3: Smart Contract Development (4 months)
    84→- Solidity contracts for royalty tracking and distribution
    85→- Comprehensive testing framework for smart contract validation
    86→- Publisher onboarding flow with role-based access control
    87→
    88→### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (6 months)
    89→- Integrated with Xbox store transaction pipeline
    90→- Parallel processing with existing system for validation
    91→- Security audit with external blockchain specialists
    92→
    93→## Results
    94→
    95→- **99% faster processing** — Royalty calculation from weeks to near real-time
    96→- **45 days → 4 minutes** — Publishers went from waiting 45 days for royalty data to accessing it in under 4 minutes
    97→- **40%+ operational effort reduction** — Automated system eliminated manual reconciliation
    98→- **Zero disputed payments post-launch** — Transparent, immutable audit trail eliminated disputes
    99→
   100→The system processes royalty payments for Microsoft's gaming ecosystem serving **2.7B+ consumers worldwide**. EY and Microsoft published this as a reference case study for enterprise blockchain adoption.
   101→
   102→> "By implementing a blockchain-based network and streamlined royalty processing, game publishers and Xbox benefit from a more trusted, transparent and connected system from contract creation through to royalty settlements." — Luke Fewel, General Manager, Global Finance Operations, Microsoft
   103→
   104→**Ubisoft** was early adopter. EY Global Blockchain Leader Paul Brody cited this as a breakthrough in "ecosystem-level automation."
   105→
   106→## What I Learned
   107→
   108→**What worked:**
   109→- POC that proved throughput—eliminated "blockchain can't scale" objection early
   110→- Private consortium satisfied both transparency AND privacy requirements
   111→- Docker/K8s infrastructure made deployment reproducible and auditable
   112→- Comprehensive testing framework caught bugs before production
   113→
   114→**What didn't:**
   115→- Underestimated key management complexity. Spent 3 extra months on secure key handling that should have been scoped from start
   116→- Tried to build everything in-house initially. Should have leveraged Azure blockchain services earlier
   117→- Solidity talent was scarce in 2016. Had to train existing team, slowed development
   118→
   119→> Enterprise blockchain is 20% technical and 80% organizational. The hard part isn't building the system—it's convincing stakeholders to trust a new paradigm.
   120→
   121→If I did it again: bring in a blockchain specialist consultant for the first 3 months. Learning Solidity security patterns through trial and error was risky and slow.

    89→> **ATTENTION ALL AI AGENTS**: These rules are mandatory.
    90→
    91→### 3.1 Session Logging — MANDATORY
    92→
    93→At **end of every session**, update Part VI (Session Log) with:
    94→- Summary (1-2 sentences)
    95→- Key changes (bullet list)
    96→- Files changed
    97→- Next actions
    98→
    99→### 3.2 Design System First
   100→
   101→> "If it isn't in the Design System, it doesn't exist."
   102→
   103→| Rule | Description |
   104→|------|-------------|
   105→| Single Source | `context/DESIGN.md` + `src/styles/globals.css` |

   114→| Feature Branches | Create descriptive branches |
   115→| Pull Requests | Use `gh pr create`, squash merge |
   116→
   117→### 3.4 Before Finalizing UI Work
   118→
   119→- [ ] Used CSS variables from `globals.css`?

   151→## Part V: Capstone Quality Pipeline
   152→
   153→### Overview
   154→
   155→YAML is canonical. JSON is derived. Every claim must be traceable.
   156→
   157→```
   158→Knowledge Base → Variant YAML → sync → JSON → eval → redteam → Deploy
   159→```
   160→
   161→### Commands
   162→
   163→```bash
   164→npm run variants:sync              # YAML→JSON
   165→npm run eval:variant -- --slug X   # Generate claims ledger
   166→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug X # Adversarial scan
   167→npm run ucv-cli                    # Interactive dashboard
   168→```
   169→
   170→### Quality Gates
   171→
   172→| Check | Catches |
   173→|-------|---------|
   174→| `RT-SEC-SECRETS` | API keys, tokens |
   175→| `RT-SEC-CONFIDENTIAL` | NDA language |
   176→| `RT-TONE-SYCOPHANCY` | "thrilled", "dream company" |

     2→title: "Building a Universal CV Engine"
     3→date: "2024-12-22"
     4→excerpt: "How a career transition led to building an AI-powered portfolio system—combining Web3 experience, an AI PM certification capstone, and a lot of late nights."
     5→tags: ["Career", "AI", "Portfolio", "Capstone"]
     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Found myself between roles. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*
    10→
    11→I knew two things: I wanted to stay at the intersection of Web3 and AI, and I needed a better way to present my work. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. LinkedIn felt like shouting into the void.
    12→
    13→So I started building.
    14→
    15→## From Resume to Portfolio
    16→
    17→First version was just a static page. More resume than portfolio—bullet points, job titles, the usual. It worked, but it didn't *differentiate*.
    18→
    19→I needed a brand. Something that captured what I actually do: build trust infrastructure at the edge of new technology. "Edge of Trust" stuck.
    20→
    21→The portfolio evolved. Case studies instead of bullet points. Real metrics instead of vague impact claims. A design system that didn't look like every other developer portfolio.
    22→
    23→But I wanted more.
    24→
    25→## The Capstone Connection
    26→
    27→While building the portfolio, I was taking the [AI Product Management Certification](https://maven.com/product-faculty/ai-product-management-certification) from Product Faculty. The course teaches a 4D approach to building AI features: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.
    28→
    29→The certification requires a capstone project. Most people build something separate. I thought: why not combine them?
    30→
    31→What if the portfolio itself was the capstone? What if I built an AI-powered system that could generate targeted portfolio variants for specific job applications?
    32→
    33→That's how Universal CV was born.
    34→
    35→## What Universal CV Actually Is
    36→
    37→The core idea is simple: create targeted portfolio pages that are accurate without embellishment, tailored to specific roles based on my actual experience data and the job description I'm applying for.
    38→
    39→The system has three parts:
    40→
    41→**1. Knowledge Base**
    42→All my achievements, metrics, and stories stored in structured YAML. Every claim traceable to a source. No hallucination possible because the AI can only surface what's already documented.
    43→
    44→**2. Variant Engine**
    45→Takes a job description, matches it against my knowledge base, and generates a customized portfolio variant. Different emphasis for different roles—infrastructure PM vs. developer tools PM vs. Web3 PM.
    46→
    47→**3. Quality Pipeline**
    48→This is where it gets interesting. I built an eval and red-teaming harness:
    49→
    50→```
    51→Knowledge Base → Variant YAML → Sync → Eval → Red Team → Deploy
    52→```
    53→
    54→The eval step extracts every claim and finds candidate sources. The red team step scans for:
    55→- Sycophantic language ("thrilled to apply")
    56→- Unverified metrics
    57→- Cross-variant contamination (mentioning wrong company)
    58→- Confidential information leaks
    59→
    60→If a variant doesn't pass the gates, it doesn't ship.
    61→
    62→## Why This Matters
    63→
    64→Most AI-generated content has a trust problem. It sounds plausible but might be fabricated. For a portfolio—where your professional reputation is on the line—that's unacceptable.
    65→
    66→Universal CV inverts the approach. Instead of generating content and hoping it's accurate, it:
    67→1. Starts with verified source data
    68→2. Constrains generation to that data
    69→3. Evaluates every claim against sources
    70→4. Red-teams for tone and accuracy issues
    71→
    72→The AI assists with targeting and presentation. The facts come from me.
    73→
    74→## What I've Built So Far
    75→
    76→- Portfolio site with 4 case studies, 3 blog posts, full design system
    77→- Variant engine supporting 5 targeted variants
    78→- Claims evaluation pipeline with source matching
    79→- Red team scanner with 8+ automated checks
    80→- Interactive CLI dashboard (`npm run ucv-cli`) for managing the whole flow
    81→
    82→## What's Next
    83→
    84→Still working on the evaluation flow. The harness is built, but I want to run proper experiments:
    85→- How well does variant targeting match JD requirements?
    86→- What's the false negative rate on the red team checks?
    87→- Can I automate more of the claim verification?
    88→
    89→Goal is to open-source this once the capstone is complete. Job searching sucks. Maybe this helps someone else.
    90→
    91→## The Real Outcome
    92→
    93→At the end of this, I'll have:
    94→
    95→1. **A professional-grade portfolio** — Not a template, a system
    96→2. **Universal CV engine** — AI-powered variant generation with quality gates
    97→3. **Deep understanding of AI evaluation** — Not just theory, hands-on implementation
    98→
    99→Career transitions create space. This one let me build something I wouldn't have built otherwise.
   100→

    28→---
    29→
    30→Without a scalable process, we'd either integrate risky protocols too fast (compliance failure) or move too slow and lose institutional clients to competitors with broader chain support.
    31→
    32→## The Challenge
    33→
    34→Rapid L2 ecosystem growth meant constant requests to support new chains. Each integration required coordination across 4+ internal teams and external protocol teams—with no standardized process. We were leaving revenue on the table while competitors moved faster.
    35→
    36→**The constraints:**
    37→- Each protocol has unique security models requiring custom evaluation
    38→- Compliance review bottleneck—single reviewer for all protocols
    39→- Engineering bandwidth split across maintenance and new integrations
    40→- Client pressure to support 'hot' new chains immediately
    41→
    42→## The Approach
    43→
    44→My hypothesis: a standardized evaluation framework would let us say 'no' confidently to 60% of requests while fast-tracking high-value integrations—turning our bottleneck into a competitive advantage of 'institutional rigor.'
    45→
    46→### Alternatives Considered
    47→
    48→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    49→|--------|------------|---------|
    50→| Case-by-case evaluation | Flexible, context-specific | Didn't scale—each integration took 12+ weeks with no predictability |
    51→| Outsource protocol research | Faster assessment, frees resources | Security evaluation couldn't be outsourced—clients needed our stamp of approval |
    52→| Only support top 5 chains | Simplest approach | Client demand was for emerging chains. Top 5 only would lose differentiation |
    53→
    54→**Chosen path:** Built RICE-based evaluation framework with parallel workstreams: security, compliance, and engineering running simultaneously rather than sequentially.
    55→
    56→## Key Decision
    57→
    58→**Build framework vs. hire more people**
    59→
    60→Initial instinct was to request additional headcount. Leadership asked for process improvement first.
    61→
    62→Built framework that reduced per-integration effort by 40%, making existing team 2x more effective without new hires.
    63→
    64→> Framework became template for other product teams. Saved estimated $200K in hiring costs while increasing throughput.
    65→
    66→## Execution
    67→
    68→### Phase 1: Framework Design (3 weeks)
    69→- Audited previous 5 integrations to identify bottlenecks and common failure modes
    70→- Created RICE scoring criteria: Reach (client demand), Impact (revenue), Confidence (security), Effort (eng complexity)
    71→- Designed parallel evaluation tracks so compliance doesn't block engineering research
    72→
    73→### Phase 2: Stakeholder Alignment (2 weeks)
    74→- Presented framework to engineering, compliance, and BD leadership
    75→- Negotiated SLAs: 2-week initial assessment, 6-week full integration
    76→- Created RACI matrix clarifying who owns each evaluation component
    77→
    78→### Phase 3: Pilot & Iteration (4 weeks)
    79→- Piloted framework with Base and Arbitrum integrations running in parallel
    80→- Identified gaps: needed better handoff documentation between teams
    81→- Added 'integration playbook' template based on pilot learnings
    82→
    83→### Phase 4: Scale & Operationalize (Ongoing)
    84→- Shipped 7+ protocols using framework (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Plume, Citrea, BOB, Aztec)
    85→- Trained BD team to do initial RICE scoring before escalating to PM
    86→- Created monthly 'protocol health' review for ongoing risk monitoring
    87→
    88→## Results
    89→
    90→- **7+ protocols shipped** — Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Plume, Citrea, BOB, Aztec—mix of established and emerging chains
    91→- **40% faster integration** — From 12+ weeks average to ~7 weeks for standard integrations
    92→- **3 parallel launches** — First time we shipped multiple protocols simultaneously
    93→
    94→Framework became company standard. BD team now self-serves on initial evaluation, reducing PM involvement in early stages by 60%.
    95→
    96→## What I Learned
    97→
    98→**What worked:**
    99→- RICE framework gave us language to say 'no' without it feeling arbitrary
   100→- Parallel workstreams eliminated the 'waiting on compliance' blocker
   101→- Playbook template reduced 'how do we do this again?' overhead
   102→- Monthly health reviews caught one protocol degradation before client impact
   103→
   104→**What didn't:**
   105→- Initial framework was too complex—had 15 evaluation criteria. Simplified to 8 after feedback that teams weren't using it
   106→- Didn't involve BD early enough. They felt blindsided by framework that affected their conversations
   107→- Underestimated documentation maintenance burden. Playbooks got stale without dedicated owner
   108→
   109→> The best frameworks are ones people actually use. Simplicity beats comprehensiveness. If you need a training session to explain it, it's too complex.
   110→
   111→If I did it again, I'd start with BD as co-creators of the framework, not recipients of it. Their buy-in earlier would have accelerated adoption by weeks.

     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Too many portfolios with broken links, malformed YAML, inconsistent data structures. The solution isn't "be more careful"—it's automation.
    10→
    11→## The Problem with Manual Validation
    12→
    13→When you're managing a portfolio with multiple content types (case studies, blog posts, projects), manual checking doesn't scale:
    14→
    15→**Common mistakes:**
    16→- Typos in YAML keys (`compnay` instead of `company`)
    17→- Wrong date formats (`12/15/2024` vs. `2024-12-15`)
    18→- Missing required fields that crash builds
    19→- Duplicate IDs between case studies
    20→- Invalid URLs that go unnoticed
    21→
    22→These errors often don't surface until:
    23→1. Your build fails in CI/CD
    24→2. A recruiter clicks a broken link
    25→3. Your case study drawer shows `undefined`
    26→
    27→By then, it's too late.
    28→
    29→## The Solution: Schema Validation
    30→
    31→The answer is **Zod schemas** combined with a validation CLI.
    32→
    33→### What This Looks Like
    34→
    35→```typescript
    36→// Define your schema once
    37→const CaseStudySchema = z.object({
    38→  id: z.number(),
    39→  title: z.string(),
    40→  year: z.string(),
    41→  // ... all your fields
    42→});
    43→
    44→// Validate before commit
    45→validateFile(caseStudy, CaseStudySchema);
    46→```
    47→
    48→### Benefits
    49→
    50→1. **Catch errors early** - Before they reach production
    51→2. **Self-documenting** - Schema is your source of truth
    52→3. **Type safety** - TypeScript types derived from schemas
    53→4. **Fast feedback** - Run validation in <1 second
    54→5. **CI/CD integration** - Block bad commits automatically
    55→
    56→## Real-World Example
    57→
    58→Here's what validation caught in my portfolio:
    59→
    60→```bash
    61→npm run validate
    62→
    63→✗ Case Study: 05-new-project.md
    64→  ✗ hook.impactMetric.value: Required
    65→  ✗ year: Expected YYYY or YYYY-YY format
    66→  ✗ cta.action: Invalid enum value
    67→```
    68→
    69→Without validation, these would have crashed my build or shown broken UI.
    70→
    71→## Implementation
    72→
    73→**1. Define schemas:**
    74→```typescript
    75→export const CaseStudySchema = z.object({
    76→  id: z.number(),
    77→  slug: z.string(),
    78→  title: z.string(),
    79→  company: z.string(),
    80→  year: z.string(),
    81→  // ...
    82→});
    83→```
    84→
    85→**2. Create validation script:**
    86→```typescript
    87→function validateContent() {
    88→  const files = readAllContent();
    89→  files.forEach(file => {
    90→    const result = schema.safeParse(file);
    91→    if (!result.success) {
    92→      console.error(result.error);
    93→      process.exit(1);
    94→    }
    95→  });
    96→}
    97→```
    98→
    99→**3. Add to package.json:**
   100→```json
   101→{
   102→  "scripts": {
   103→    "validate": "tsx scripts/validate-content.ts"
   104→  }
   105→}
   106→```
   107→
   108→**4. Run before commits:**
   109→```bash
   110→npm run validate
   111→git commit -m "Add new case study"
   112→```
   113→
   114→## Beyond Portfolios
   115→
   116→This pattern works for any content-driven application:
   117→- Documentation sites
   118→- Blog platforms
   119→- Product catalogs
   120→- Configuration management
   121→
   122→The key insight: **treat content as code**.
   123→
   124→## Key Takeaways
   125→
   126→- **Validation is infrastructure** — Not optional, foundational
   127→- **Fail fast** — Catch errors locally, not in production
   128→- **Automate everything** — Manual checks don't scale
   129→- **Use types** — Schemas + TypeScript = confidence
   130→
   131→## Next Steps
   132→
   133→If you're maintaining a content-heavy portfolio:
   134→
   135→1. Add Zod
   136→2. Define schemas for each content type
   137→3. Write validation script
   138→4. Run validation in CI/CD
   139→5. Create templates with correct structure
   140→
   141→Your future self will thank you when the CLI catches a missing field before a recruiter sees a broken page.
   142→

     7→---
     8→
     9→After years building infrastructure for institutional crypto custody, I'm convinced the next wave of crypto adoption won't come from retail traders or traditional institutions. It'll come from AI agents.
    10→
    11→## The Problem with Today's AI Agents
    12→
    13→AI agents are powerful at reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks. But they have a critical limitation: **they can't hold value or make credible commitments**.
    14→
    15→When an AI agent promises to do something in exchange for payment, there's no enforcement mechanism. The agent can't:
    16→- Hold funds in escrow
    17→- Post collateral
    18→- Be slashed for misbehavior
    19→- Participate in trustless coordination
    20→
    21→On-chain execution solves this.
    22→
    23→## Smart Contracts as Agent Infrastructure
    24→
    25→Smart contracts provide exactly what AI agents need:
    26→
    27→1. **Programmable escrow** — Funds are held until conditions are met
    28→2. **Verifiable commitments** — Actions are transparent and auditable
    29→3. **Trustless coordination** — Multiple agents can collaborate without trusting each other
    30→4. **Economic incentives** — Stake, slash, and reward mechanisms align behavior
    31→
    32→```solidity
    33→// Example: Simple agent task escrow
    34→contract AgentTask {
    35→    address public requester;
    36→    address public agent;
    37→    uint256 public reward;
    38→    bytes32 public taskHash;
    39→    
    40→    function completeTask(bytes calldata proof) external {
    41→        require(msg.sender == agent);
    42→        require(verifyProof(proof, taskHash));
    43→        payable(agent).transfer(reward);
    44→    }
    45→}
    46→```
    47→
    48→## What I'm Watching
    49→
    50→A few developments that excite me:
    51→
    52→**Agent-to-agent payments**: Services like OpenAI's function calling combined with crypto payments could enable agents to hire other agents. Imagine an AI that can spin up compute, pay for API calls, and coordinate with specialized agents—all autonomously.
    53→
    54→**MPC for agent wallets**: The same MPC infrastructure we built for institutional custody could power agent wallets. Agents could control keys without any single party having full access.
    55→
    56→**On-chain reputation**: As agents accumulate history on-chain, we'll see emergence of agent credit scores and reputation systems.
    57→
    58→## The PM Perspective
    59→
    60→This space inverts traditional UX design. We're not designing for humans—we're designing for:
    61→
    62→- **Deterministic execution** over intuitive interfaces
    63→- **API-first** over UI-first
    64→- **Composability** over integration
    65→- **Auditability** over privacy (in many cases)
    66→
    67→The primitives are different from human-centric crypto products. That's what makes it interesting.

    40→
    41→Building autonomous agent systems is straightforward. Building agent systems that reliably orchestrate multiple models, tools, and data sources at scale is a different challenge entirely.
    42→
    43→## The Challenge
    44→
    45→Developer teams wanted to build multi-agent applications but faced massive operational complexity: managing model fallbacks, handling rate limits across providers, debugging non-deterministic failures, and ensuring cost control.
    46→
    47→**The constraints:**
    48→- Support 5+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, local models)
    49→- Sub-200ms orchestration overhead
    50→- Cost budgets enforced per-developer, per-project
    51→- Observable failures with replay capability
    52→- Zero-downtime model switching
    53→
    54→## The Approach
    55→
    56→My hypothesis: we could abstract orchestration complexity into a platform layer—letting developers focus on agent logic while we handled infrastructure concerns like failover, rate limiting, and cost control.
    57→
    58→### Alternatives Considered
    59→
    60→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    61→|--------|------------|---------|
    62→| Direct provider SDKs | Maximum flexibility, developers own infrastructure | Each team rebuilding same orchestration logic—unsustainable at scale |
    63→| Existing agent frameworks | Fast time-to-market, proven patterns | Too opinionated, vendor lock-in, missing cost controls |
    64→| Serverless functions | Simple deployment, auto-scaling | Cold starts unacceptable for real-time agent responses |
    65→
    66→**Chosen path:** Built orchestration service with SDK that handles routing, fallbacks, and observability—deployed as a sidecar for low latency.
    67→
    68→## Key Decision
    69→
    70→**Build vs. buy orchestration layer**
    71→
    72→Initial plan was to adopt LangChain/similar framework. After prototyping, discovered cost control and multi-provider fallback were missing features that would require forking.
    73→
    74→Decision: Build orchestration primitives ourselves, integrate with existing tools for non-critical paths.
    75→
    76→> Validated when top 10 customers cited "cost control" and "provider flexibility" as key retention drivers.
    77→
    78→## Execution
    79→
    80→### Phase 1: Discovery (3 weeks)
    81→- Interviewed 25 early-access developers about orchestration pain points
    82→- Mapped failure modes across 5 LLM providers
    83→- Prototyped cost tracking middleware
    84→
    85→### Phase 2: MVP (6 weeks)
    86→- Built routing layer with provider fallback logic
    87→- Implemented per-project cost budgets
    88→- Created observability dashboard for agent traces
    89→
    90→### Phase 3: Scale (5 weeks)
    91→- Added replay functionality for debugging
    92→- Optimized latency to <100ms P95
    93→- Shipped SDK with TypeScript/Python support
    94→
    95→## Results
    96→
    97→- **50K+ active developers** — Exceeded 6-month goal in 4 months
    98→- **1M+ daily agent calls** — Production workloads across 200+ companies
    99→- **300% adoption increase** — vs. previous quarter without orchestration layer
   100→
   101→Platform became the de facto standard for multi-agent applications in our ecosystem.
   102→
   103→## What I Learned
   104→
   105→**What worked:**
   106→- Focusing on cost control early—developers won't adopt AI infrastructure they can't budget for
   107→- Replay functionality for debugging was unexpectedly critical—agents fail in unpredictable ways
   108→- SDK-first approach reduced integration friction massively
   109→
   110→**What didn't:**
   111→- Initially over-indexed on latency optimization before validating cost control demand
   112→- Built custom observability instead of integrating existing APM tools—wasted 2 weeks
   113→- Underestimated complexity of provider-specific rate limit handling
   114→
   115→> In AI infrastructure, the competitive moat is operational reliability, not algorithmic innovation. Developers choose platforms they trust won't surprise them with costs or failures.
   116→
   117→If I did it again, I'd validate cost control as the #1 feature with customers before building anything else.

     2→title: "The Hidden Complexity of ETF-Grade Staking"
     3→date: "2024-11-15"
     4→excerpt: "What it really takes to build staking infrastructure for institutional clients—the compliance, custody, and coordination challenges nobody talks about."
     5→tags: ["Staking", "Ethereum", "Custody", "Institutional"]
     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→"ETH staking" sounds straightforward: deposit 32 ETH, run a validator, earn yield. Building staking infrastructure for institutional clients like ETF providers? Entirely different beast.
    10→
    11→## The Custody Paradox
    12→
    13→Institutional staking creates a fundamental tension.
    14→
    15→**For maximum yield**, you want:
    16→- Distributed validator infrastructure
    17→- Quick slashing response
    18→- Flexible withdrawal strategies
    19→- MEV optimization
    20→
    21→**For custody compliance**, you need:
    22→- Full control of withdrawal keys
    23→- Auditable key management
    24→- Regulatory-approved processes
    25→- Cold storage capabilities
    26→
    27→These requirements conflict. Distributed architecture optimizes uptime but creates custody concerns. Cold storage satisfies auditors but slows response times.
    28→
    29→## Key Decisions We Faced
    30→
    31→### 1. In-House vs. Staking-as-a-Service
    32→
    33→This was our biggest decision. Third-party staking providers offered:
    34→- Faster time-to-market
    35→- Battle-tested infrastructure
    36→- Less operational burden
    37→
    38→But in-house infrastructure gave us:
    39→- Full custody key control
    40→- Regulatory defensibility
    41→- Custom compliance integration
    42→- Better margins long-term
    43→
    44→We chose in-house. For ETF-grade custody, there's no substitute for full key ownership.
    45→
    46→### 2. Validator Client Diversity
    47→
    48→Ethereum's decentralization depends on running diverse validator clients. But diversity creates operational complexity:
    49→
    50→```
    51→Our approach:
    52→├── Primary: Lighthouse (40%)
    53→├── Secondary: Prysm (30%)
    54→├── Tertiary: Teku (20%)
    55→└── Fallback: Nimbus (10%)
    56→```
    57→
    58→Each client has different:
    59→- Resource requirements
    60→- Slashing DB formats
    61→- API interfaces
    62→- Upgrade schedules
    63→
    64→Managing this diversity while maintaining consistent SLAs is a product challenge in itself.
    65→
    66→### 3. Slashing Prevention
    67→
    68→A single slashing event could cost millions and destroy institutional trust. Our prevention strategy:
    69→
    70→1. **Web3Signer** — Air-gapped signing with slashing protection
    71→2. **Redundant slashing DBs** — Multiple sources of truth
    72→3. **Alert systems** — Sub-second detection of potential issues
    73→4. **Graceful degradation** — Better to miss a few attestations than risk slashing
    74→
    75→## The Coordination Problem
    76→
    77→Institutional staking isn't just a technical challenge—it's a coordination challenge across:
    78→
    79→- **Engineering**: Building reliable infrastructure
    80→- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements
    81→- **Legal**: Structuring agreements properly
    82→- **Clients**: Managing expectations and communication
    83→- **Regulators**: Staying ahead of evolving guidance
    84→
    85→As a PM, my job is often to be the translator between these groups, ensuring technical decisions account for compliance constraints and vice versa.
    86→
    87→## Lessons Learned
    88→
    89→**Start with compliance, not features.** Doesn't matter how good your yield is if you can't pass an audit.
    90→
    91→**Institutional clients want boring.** They don't want the best APY. They want predictable, auditable, defensible infrastructure.
    92→
    93→**The moat is trust.** Anyone can run validators. Not everyone can do it with the paper trail institutions require.
    94→
    95→**Document everything.** Every decision, every trade-off, every incident response. Invaluable during audits and client reviews.
    96→
    97→## Looking Ahead
    98→
    99→The ETH staking market is still early. As more ETFs come online and institutions get comfortable with crypto, the opportunity is massive. But winning requires a different playbook than consumer crypto—one built on compliance, reliability, and trust.

    17→*   **Do not** add "snowflake" styles without justification.
    18→*   **Updates**: If you need a new style, add it to `globals.css` AND document it here first.
    19→
    20→## Quick Start
    21→
    22→### Theme System
    23→
    24→The design system uses CSS custom properties for theming. Toggle between dark and light modes using the `ThemeToggle` component.
    25→
    26→```tsx
    27→import { ThemeProvider } from './context/ThemeContext';
    28→
    29→function App() {
    30→  return (
    31→    <ThemeProvider>
    32→      {/* Your app content */}
    33→    </ThemeProvider>
    34→  );
    35→}
    36→```
    37→
    38→### Using Components
    39→
    40→All components are available in the `/components` directory:
    41→
    42→```tsx
    43→import { Button } from './components/Button';
    44→import { Tag } from './components/Tag';
    45→import { CaseStudyCard } from './components/CaseStudyCard';
    46→
    47→// Primary button
    48→<Button variant="primary" href="#contact">Get in touch</Button>
    49→
    50→// Secondary button
    51→<Button variant="secondary" href="#work">View work</Button>
    52→
    53→// Tags
    54→<Tag>Web3</Tag>
    55→<Tag>Product</Tag>
    56→```
    57→
    58→## Available Components
    59→
    60→### Buttons
    61→
    62→- **Primary Button**: Solid background with accent hover
    63→- **Secondary Button**: Text link with underline
    64→
    65→```tsx
    66→<Button variant="primary">Primary Action</Button>
    67→<Button variant="secondary">Secondary Action</Button>
    68→```
    69→
    70→### Cards
    71→
    72→#### Case Study Card
    73→Displays project information with metrics:
    74→
    75→```tsx
    76→<CaseStudyCard
    77→  year="2024"
    78→  title="Project Title"
    79→  description="Project description"
    80→  tags={['Tag1', 'Tag2']}
    81→  metrics={[
    82→    { label: 'Metric', value: '100K' }
    83→  ]}
    84→/>
    85→```
    86→
    87→#### Experience Card
    88→Shows work experience with achievements:
    89→
    90→```tsx
    91→<ExperienceCard
    92→  period="2023 — Present"
    93→  company="Company Name"
    94→  role="Role Title"
    95→  description="Description"
    96→  achievements={['Achievement 1', 'Achievement 2']}
    97→/>
    98→```
    99→
   100→#### Certification Card

A comprehensive design system for a Web3 product manager portfolio featuring dark and light modes with elegant typography and consistent spacing.

## Features

- 🎨 **Dual Theme Support**: Seamless dark and light mode switching
- 🔤 **Premium Typography**: Instrument Serif & Instrument Sans font pairing
- 📐 **Consistent Spacing**: Token-based spacing system
- 🧩 **Reusable Components**: Production-ready React components
- ✨ **Smooth Animations**: Premium easing and transitions
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop optimized

## 🚨 Governance ("The Prime Directive")
**The Design System is the Single Source of Truth.**
*   **Do not** use hardcoded values in components.
*   **Do not** add "snowflake" styles without justification.
*   **Updates**: If you need a new style, add it to `globals.css` AND document it here first.

## Quick Start

### Theme System

The design system uses CSS custom properties for theming. Toggle between dark and light modes using the `ThemeToggle` component.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from './context/ThemeContext';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      {/* Your app content */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Using Components

All components are available in the `/components` directory:

```tsx
import { Button } from './components/Button';
import { Tag } from './components/Tag';
import { CaseStudyCard } from './components/CaseStudyCard';

// Primary button
<Button variant="primary" href="#contact">Get in touch</Button>

// Secondary button
<Button variant="secondary" href="#work">View work</Button>

// Tags
<Tag>Web3</Tag>
<Tag>Product</Tag>
```

## Available Components

### Buttons

- **Primary Button**: Solid background with accent hover
- **Secondary Button**: Text link with underline

```tsx
<Button variant="primary">Primary Action</Button>
<Button variant="secondary">Secondary Action</Button>
```

### Cards

#### Case Study Card
Displays project information with metrics:

```tsx
<CaseStudyCard
  year="2024"
  title="Project Title"
  description="Project description"
  tags={['Tag1', 'Tag2']}
```

     3→date: "2024-12-22"
     4→excerpt: "How a career transition led to building an AI-powered portfolio system—combining Web3 experience, an AI PM certification capstone, and a lot of late nights."
     5→tags: ["Career", "AI", "Portfolio", "Capstone"]
     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Found myself between roles. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*
    10→
    11→I knew two things: I wanted to stay at the intersection of Web3 and AI, and I needed a better way to present my work. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. LinkedIn felt like shouting into the void.
    12→
    13→So I started building.
    14→
    15→## From Resume to Portfolio
    16→
    17→First version was just a static page. More resume than portfolio—bullet points, job titles, the usual. It worked, but it didn't *differentiate*.
    18→
    19→I needed a brand. Something that captured what I actually do: build trust infrastructure at the edge of new technology. "Edge of Trust" stuck.
    20→
    21→The portfolio evolved. Case studies instead of bullet points. Real metrics instead of vague impact claims. A design system that didn't look like every other developer portfolio.
    22→
    23→But I wanted more.
    24→
    25→## The Capstone Connection
    26→
    27→While building the portfolio, I was taking the [AI Product Management Certification](https://maven.com/product-faculty/ai-product-management-certification) from Product Faculty. The course teaches a 4D approach to building AI features: Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver.
    28→
    29→The certification requires a capstone project. Most people build something separate. I thought: why not combine them?
    30→
    31→What if the portfolio itself was the capstone? What if I built an AI-powered system that could generate targeted portfolio variants for specific job applications?
    32→
    33→That's how Universal CV was born.
    34→
    35→## What Universal CV Actually Is
    36→
    37→The core idea is simple: create targeted portfolio pages that are accurate without embellishment, tailored to specific roles based on my actual experience data and the job description I'm applying for.
    38→
    39→The system has three parts:
    40→
    41→**1. Knowledge Base**
    42→All my achievements, metrics, and stories stored in structured YAML. Every claim traceable to a source. No hallucination possible because the AI can only surface what's already documented.
    43→
    44→**2. Variant Engine**
    45→Takes a job description, matches it against my knowledge base, and generates a customized portfolio variant. Different emphasis for different roles—infrastructure PM vs. developer tools PM vs. Web3 PM.
    46→
    47→**3. Quality Pipeline**
    48→This is where it gets interesting. I built an eval and red-teaming harness:
    49→
    50→```
    51→Knowledge Base → Variant YAML → Sync → Eval → Red Team → Deploy
    52→```
    53→
    54→The eval step extracts every claim and finds candidate sources. The red team step scans for:
    55→- Sycophantic language ("thrilled to apply")
    56→- Unverified metrics
    57→- Cross-variant contamination (mentioning wrong company)
    58→- Confidential information leaks
    59→
    60→If a variant doesn't pass the gates, it doesn't ship.
    61→
    62→## Why This Matters
    63→
    64→Most AI-generated content has a trust problem. It sounds plausible but might be fabricated. For a portfolio—where your professional reputation is on the line—that's unacceptable.
    65→
    66→Universal CV inverts the approach. Instead of generating content and hoping it's accurate, it:
    67→1. Starts with verified source data
    68→2. Constrains generation to that data
    69→3. Evaluates every claim against sources
    70→4. Red-teams for tone and accuracy issues
    71→
    72→The AI assists with targeting and presentation. The facts come from me.
    73→
    74→## What I've Built So Far
    75→
    76→- Portfolio site with 4 case studies, 3 blog posts, full design system
    77→- Variant engine supporting 5 targeted variants
    78→- Claims evaluation pipeline with source matching
    79→- Red team scanner with 8+ automated checks
    80→- Interactive CLI dashboard (`npm run ucv-cli`) for managing the whole flow
    81→
    82→## What's Next
    83→
    84→Still working on the evaluation flow. The harness is built, but I want to run proper experiments:
    85→- How well does variant targeting match JD requirements?
    86→- What's the false negative rate on the red team checks?
    87→- Can I automate more of the claim verification?
    88→
    89→Goal is to open-source this once the capstone is complete. Job searching sucks. Maybe this helps someone else.
    90→
    91→## The Real Outcome
    92→
    93→At the end of this, I'll have:
    94→
    95→1. **A professional-grade portfolio** — Not a template, a system
    96→2. **Universal CV engine** — AI-powered variant generation with quality gates
    97→3. **Deep understanding of AI evaluation** — Not just theory, hands-on implementation
    98→
    99→Career transitions create space. This one let me build something I wouldn't have built otherwise.
   100→

    36→---
    37→
    38→Liquidations, governance votes, whale movements—every major on-chain event was invisible until it was too late. Traders missed opportunities. Protocols couldn't react fast enough. Communities were always behind.
    39→
    40→## The Challenge
    41→
    42→Blockchains are transparent, but staying ahead of critical events required complex custom setups, constant polling, or expensive infrastructure. No simple way to get real-time notifications about what's happening on-chain.
    43→
    44→The constraints:
    45→- Bootstrapping solo with limited resources
    46→- Multiple chains needed (Ethereum, Cosmos ecosystem)
    47→- Sub-second latency or it's worthless—alerts after the fact are just news
    48→- Developer SDK simple enough for quick integration
    49→
    50→## The Approach
    51→
    52→The bet: a scenario-based alerting platform with no-code configuration. Make tracking whale wallets as easy as setting up a Google Alert.
    53→
    54→### Alternatives Considered
    55→
    56→| Option | Trade-offs | Why Not |
    57→|--------|------------|---------|
    58→| Build for enterprise only | Higher contract values, clearer monetization | Long sales cycles, needed traction fast |
    59→| Developer-only API | Simpler product, focused use case | Missed larger opportunity in no-code market |
    60→| Single chain focus | Faster development, deeper integration | Multi-chain was the clear direction of the ecosystem |
    61→
    62→We built both: no-code consumer platform AND developer SDK. Started with Cosmos where competition was thinner.
    63→
    64→## Key Decision
    65→
    66→**Launching as default alerting provider on Archway mainnet**
    67→
    68→Archway (Cosmos SDK L1) was launching their mainnet. I pitched Mempools as their official alerting infrastructure.
    69→
    70→Launched Archway-Alerts.com the same day as their mainnet. Became the default platform for the ecosystem.
    71→
    72→> Instead of competing for developers, we became the recommended solution. One partnership gave us instant distribution and credibility.
    73→
    74→## Execution
    75→
    76→### Phase 1: Core Platform (8 weeks)
    77→- Real-time event monitoring infrastructure on Ethereum
    78→- Scenario builder with AND/OR logic for complex alerts
    79→- Multi-channel delivery: Telegram, Discord, webhooks, email
    80→

Excellent! I've found all the documentation about Dmitrii's writing style. Here's a comprehensive summary:

## Dmitrii's Writing Style Documentation

### Official Style Guide
**Location:** `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/.claude/skills/dmitrii-writing-style/SKILL.md`

The skill documentation defines these core characteristics:

#### Voice Characteristics
- **Direct and Action-Oriented**: Gets to the point, leads with substance, values clarity over elaborate setups
- **Warm but Professional**: Friendly without being informal, natural conversational language, no corporate-speak
- **Intellectually Curious**: Probes deeper, asks "why," willing to admit uncertainty ("it feels that this is a bit over my head")
- **Practical Problem-Solver**: Always oriented toward what can be built, shipped, or acted upon

#### Formatting Preferences

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- Bullet points in emails or conversational contexts
- Excessive bold/headers in short communications
- Numbered lists unless truly sequential steps
- HTML tags in copy-paste contexts
- Robotic or overly formal phrasing
- Generic corporate language

**Preferred Patterns:**
- Flowing prose in emails and messages with natural transitions
- Tables for structured comparisons in documents
- Clear hierarchy in technical docs, minimal in casual communication
- One request per sentence in emails

#### Vocabulary Preferences
**Prefer:**
- "scope out" over "define"
- "crisp and clear" over "concise"
- "flows well" over "is readable"
- "makes sense" over "is logical"
- "up my alley" over "aligned with my interests"
- "crack [a problem]" over "solve"
- Active voice throughout

**Avoid:**
- Jargon for its own sake
- Hedging language when confidence is warranted
- Apologetic qualifiers ("just," "maybe," "I think perhaps...")
- Filler phrases ("In order to," "It should be noted that...")

#### Domain Expertise
Dmitrii operates at the intersection of:
- Web3/Blockchain (protocol terminology, tokenomics, on-chain concepts)
- Product Management (JTBD, MoSCoW, user stories, roadmaps)
- Institutional Compliance (KYC/AML, regulatory frameworks)
- AI/Agents (agent identity, attestation, autonomy)

#### Quality Checks Before Finalizing
1. Could this be said more directly?
2. Are there bullet points that should be prose?
3. Does it sound like a human wrote it?
4. Is the ask/conclusion clear?
5. Would Dmitrii actually say this out loud?

### Real-World Writing Examples

**Blog 1:** "Building a Universal CV Engine" (2024-12-22)
- Opens with vulnerability: "Found myself between roles. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*"
- Uses conversational hooks: "So I started building," "But I wanted more"
- Explains complex concepts clearly without jargon
- Includes personal perspective while maintaining professionalism

**Blog 2:** "Why Content Validation Matters for Developer Portfolios" (2024-12-15)
- Starts with problem statement: "Too many portfolios with broken links..."
- Avoids bullet points; uses flowing prose for explanations
- Practical: provides implementation examples with code
- Closes with actionable next steps

**Blog 3:** "Where AI Agents Meet On-Chain Execution" (2024-12-01)
- Opens with perspective: "After years building infrastructure..."
- Uses clear headings but flows naturally between ideas
- Domain-specific language (smart contracts, escrow, slashing) without over-explanation
- Ends with engagement: "Building here? Let's connect."

**Blog 4:** "The Hidden Complexity of ETF-Grade Staking" (2024-11-15)
- Opens with demystification: "ETH staking sounds straightforward... Entirely different beast."
- Shows tension/paradox clearly: "These requirements conflict."
- Uses structured but readable format for technical content
- Shares real decision-making perspective: "We chose in-house..."

---

### For Social Media Content

Based on the style guide and blog examples, here are the key principles for social media:

1. **Lead with substance** - Don't bury the point
2. **Use natural language** - Sound conversational, like you're speaking to someone
3. **Show, don't tell** - Include specific examples or real situations
4. **Direct and clear** - No fluff or hedging
5. **Domain expertise** - Talk confidently about Web3, AI, and product management
6. **Problem-focused** - Frame around real challenges and solutions
7. **Personal but not oversharing** - Share perspective without being effusive
8. **Active voice** - "I built" not "was built by me"

The writing style is distinctly human, thoughtful, and builds credibility through concrete examples rather than self-promotion.

_**Agent (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) (sidechain)**_

Perfect! I now have comprehensive insights across the entire portfolio. Let me compile the findings into a compelling summary with the top 3 learnings.

## Summary: Top 3 Learnings from Your Portfolio

Based on my thorough search through your blog posts, case studies, retrospective content, and project documentation, here are the **top 3 learnings** that stand out as the most insightful and shareable:

---

### Learning #1: **Distribution Beats Product** 
**Source:** Mempools case study + Ankr case study

The most powerful recurring theme across your work is that **who you partner with matters more than what you build**. Two specific examples:

- **Mempools**: Instead of competing for developers directly, you launched as the *default alerting provider on Archway mainnet*. One partnership with a protocol gave you instant distribution and credibility worth 100 marketing campaigns.
- **Ankr**: The tipping point wasn't a better RPC product—it was pivoting from developers to protocols as customers. Protocol partnerships became worth 10x the revenue of individual developer accounts.

**Social Media Angle**: "Built better products. They didn't matter. What mattered was who recommended us. Distribution changes everything."

---

### Learning #2: **Customer Isn't Always User—Find the Right Unit Economics**
**Source:** Ankr & Protocol Integration Framework cases

This is a subtle but game-changing insight:

- **Ankr**: Realized blockchain protocols needed infrastructure more than individual developers. Shifting your customer focus (not your product) from developers to protocols improved unit economics overnight and unlocked 15× revenue growth.
- **Protocol Integration**: Instead of hiring more people to handle integration bottlenecks, you built a framework that made your existing team 2× more effective—same team, 40% faster integrations, saved ~$200K in hiring costs.

The lesson: **sometimes the unit economics problem isn't about building better—it's about building smarter by changing who you're optimizing for**.

**Social Media Angle**: "Spent months building features. One conversation with a different customer segment solved the unit economics problem instantly."

---

### Learning #3: **Trust Is Your Moat in Institutional Markets**
**Source:** ETF-Grade Staking blog + Xbox Royalties case study

Your institutional crypto and enterprise work reveals a consistent pattern:

- **ETF Staking**: "Institutional clients want boring. They don't want the best APY. They want predictable, auditable, defensible infrastructure." The moat isn't performance—it's compliance.
- **Xbox Royalties**: "Enterprise blockchain is 20% technical and 80% organizational. The hard part isn't building the system—it's convincing stakeholders to trust a new paradigm."
- **Universal CV Engine**: Your capstone project inverts the trust problem: instead of generating content and hoping it's accurate, start with verified source data, constrain generation to that data, and red-team for accuracy.

**Social Media Angle**: "Everyone's building faster. Institutions are buying trust. Document everything, audit everything, make it defensible. That's the moat."

---

## Secondary Insights Worth Highlighting

**Learning #4: Content Validation Is Infrastructure** (from your blog post)
- Treat content as code. Zod schemas + automated validation catch errors before production. This applies beyond portfolios to any content-driven product.

**Learning #5: In AI Infrastructure, Cost Control Beats Optimization** (from AI Agent Orchestration)
- Developers won't adopt AI infrastructure they can't budget for. Competitive moat is operational reliability, not algorithmic innovation.

---

## Recommended Social Media Posts

Here are three high-engagement frameworks:

**Post 1** (Distribution Beats Product):
> "We built better products. Competitors still won. The difference? We launched as the recommended solution for an entire ecosystem instead of fighting for developer attention. Partnership > Features. Distribution > Product. #ProductManagement"

**Post 2** (Customer/User Mismatch):
> "Spent 8 months trying to win developer market. Made $130K ARR. Shifted focus from developers to the protocols they use as customers. Revenue 15×'d in 6 months. Sometimes the unit economics problem isn't your product—it's your customer definition. #SaaS"

**Post 3** (Trust as Moat):
> "Everyone's racing to build faster. In institutional crypto, I learned: speed doesn't matter. Auditability matters. Compliance matters. Trust matters. Built a royalty system for 2.7B+ Xbox consumers because it was defensible—not because it was the best. #Enterprise"

---

## File References

All these learnings are documented in:
- **Retrospective blog**: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/content/blog/2024-12-22-portfolio-retrospective.md`
- **Case studies**: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/content/case-studies/` (01-mempools.md, 02-ankr-rpc.md, 03-xbox-royalties.md)
- **Blog insights**: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/content/blog/2024-11-15-etf-grade-staking.md` and `2024-12-01-ai-agents-meet-onchain.md`
- **Scratchpad/Strategic notes**: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio/content/scratchpad/`

These three learnings are your strongest differentiators—they move beyond tactical "how we built X" into strategic insights about product positioning, market fit, and organizational trust that apply across Web3, institutional crypto, and AI infrastructure.

Excellent! Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me compile my findings into a compelling analysis for social media promotion:

---

---

### 3. What Makes It Unique & Innovative

**Innovation #1: Trust-First AI Content**
Most AI-generated portfolios hallucinate. This one inverts the approach:
- All facts stored in a knowledge base first
- AI constrained to that data only
- Every claim evaluated against sources
- Red-teamed for accuracy/tone before deployment
- This is a novel pattern for AI-assisted professional content

**Innovation #2: Dynamic Portfolio Variants**
Not a static resume. Instead:
- Single source of truth (base profile + knowledge base)
- Automatically generates 9+ personalized variants
- Each variant optimized for different company/role combos
- Seamlessly shareable as URLs (hash-routed, GitHub Pages compatible)
- Job description matching informs content emphasis

**Innovation #3: Capstone-Grade Quality Pipeline**
The portfolio itself doubles as an AI Product Management certification capstone:
- Implements full 4D lifecycle (Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver)
- Uses production-grade eval/red-teaming patterns
- Machine-checkable verification ledgers
- Could be open-sourced as reference implementation

**Innovation #4: Design System as Single Source of Truth**
- 122+ CSS variables governing every visual aspect
- Enforced theme parity (dark/light modes)
- No hardcoded pixels/colors in components
- Enables consistent theming across all personalized variants

**Innovation #5: Premium Positioning**
- Instrument Serif/Sans typography (premium feel, not generic)
- Elegant color palette (#c29a6c accent, refined neutrals)
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Premium orb effects in ambient background
- Differentiates from typical developer portfolios

**Innovation #6: Content Depth**
- Not template-based—bespoke case studies with real metrics
- Decision narratives showing trade-offs and reasoning
- Blog posts about process (meta-content about building the portfolio)
- LinkedIn-quality depth, but more interactive

**What's Different:**
- Most portfolios are static. This one is dynamic (variants + personalization)
- Most use AI for generation. This one constrains AI with verified source data
- Most focus on design. This one focuses on substance (deep case studies)
- Most are personal branding. This one is a working capstone product
- Most hide the system. This one documents it (open-sourcing roadmap)

**The Meta Angle:**
The portfolio itself is a portfolio piece. It demonstrates:
- Product thinking (eval pipeline, QA gates)
- Systems design (variant architecture, knowledge base)
- AI product maturity (trust, verification, evaluation)
- Technical craftsmanship (React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7, Zod)

This appeals to PM hiring managers, AI/ML companies, and serious product people.

---

## Recommended Social Media Themes

1. **"AI Done Right"** — Trust-first, constrained, verified portfolio variants
2. **"PM in Public"** — Capstone as content; showing work, not just results
3. **"Substance Over Flash"** — Deep case studies, measurable outcomes, real metrics
4. **"Building Edge of Trust"** — Behind-the-scenes journey (capstone series)
5. **"Job Search Reimagined"** — Personalized, prepared, differentiated approach

All of these anchor to the unique value: a professional-grade, AI-powered portfolio that prioritizes authenticity over embellishment.

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.

   110→
   111→| Rule | Description |
   112→|------|-------------|
   113→| Branch Protection | `main` is PROTECTED — no direct pushes |
   114→| Feature Branches | Create descriptive branches |
   115→| Pull Requests | Use `gh pr create`, squash merge |
   116→
   117→### 3.4 Before Finalizing UI Work

   151→## Part V: Capstone Quality Pipeline
   152→
   153→### Overview
   154→
   155→YAML is canonical. JSON is derived. Every claim must be traceable.
   156→
   157→```
   158→Knowledge Base → Variant YAML → sync → JSON → eval → redteam → Deploy
   159→```
   160→
   161→### Commands
   162→
   163→```bash
   164→npm run variants:sync              # YAML→JSON
   165→npm run eval:variant -- --slug X   # Generate claims ledger
   166→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug X # Adversarial scan
   167→npm run ucv-cli                    # Interactive dashboard
   168→```
   169→
   170→### Quality Gates
   171→
   172→| Check | Catches |
   173→|-------|---------|

   192→### Quick Reference (Patterns to Remember)
   193→
   194→| Pattern | Implementation |
   195→|---------|----------------|
   196→| Markdown links in highlights | `[Product](url)` renders as accent-colored links |
   197→| SMART bullets | 3-4 per role: `[Action] + [What] + [Metric] + [Context]` |
   198→| Schema-first workflow | Read `src/lib/schemas.ts` before writing content |
   199→
   200→### Content Locations
   201→
   202→| Content | File |
   203→|---------|------|
   204→| Experience | `content/experience/index.yaml` |
   205→| Case Studies | `content/case-studies/*.md` |
   206→| Variants | `content/variants/*.yaml` |
   207→| Schemas | `src/lib/schemas.ts` |
   208→
   209→### Validation Commands
   210→
   211→```bash
   212→npm run validate  # Check content against Zod
   213→npm run build     # Production build
   214→npm run test      # Run test suite

   219→
   220→### Current Status
   221→
   222→**Date**: 2025-12-22
   223→**Objective**: Capstone Quality Pipeline complete, evaluate CLI vs UI direction
   224→**Bundle**: ~197KB gzip initial (target <200KB ✅)
   225→**Tests**: 211 passing (10 suites)
   226→**Variants**: 5 active
   227→**CSS Variables**: 122
   228→**Premium Score**: 8.5/10
   229→
   230→**Blockers**: None
   231→
   232→**Recent Wins**:
   233→- UCV-CLI TUI dashboard shipped (PR #60) — templates, pipeline flow, error handling
   234→- Code splitting shipped (59% bundle reduction, PR #58)
   235→- Light mode polish shipped
   236→- Context docs consolidated (87% size reduction)
   237→
   238→**Current Question**:
   239→- Evaluate CLI vs UI approach for variant management
   240→- CLI: ~1,400 lines, Ink/React TUI, functional but terminal-bound
   241→- UI alternative: Web-based backoffice for broader accessibility?
   242→
   243→**Next Priority**:
   244→1. Strategic decision: Continue CLI or pivot to web UI
   245→2. Trust Battery Testimonials (deferred)
   246→3. Featured Case Study (deferred)

   116→
   117→### Key Patterns
   118→
   119→1. **Inline Styles with CSS Variables**: Components use inline `style` props with CSS variables
   120→   ```tsx
   121→   style={{ color: 'var(--color-text-primary)' }}
   122→   ```
   123→
   124→2. **Theme via data-attribute**: Theme switching uses `data-theme` on `<html>`
   125→   ```css
   126→   [data-theme="light"] { --color-background: #fafafa; }
   127→   ```
   128→
   129→3. **ThemeContext**: Provides `isDark`, `toggleTheme`, `theme` - but NOT colors (deprecated)
   130→
   131→4. **Universal CV - Variant System**: Portfolio personalization for job applications
   132→   - Base profile + variant overrides = personalized experience
   133→   - Dynamic routes via HashRouter (`/#/:company/:role`)
   134→   - VariantContext provides merged profile to components
   135→   - Sections receive `profile` prop from context (not direct imports)
   136→
   137→---
   138→
   139→## Universal CV System
   140→
   141→### Overview
   142→
   143→The Universal CV system creates personalized portfolio variants tailored to specific job applications using AI-generated overrides of the base profile.
   144→
   145→**Live Examples:**
   146→- Base: `https://edgeoftrust.com/#/`
   147→- Bloomberg TPM: `https://edgeoftrust.com/#/bloomberg/technical-product-manager`
   148→- Gensyn TPM: `https://edgeoftrust.com/#/gensyn/technical-product-manager`
   149→
   150→### Architecture
   151→
   152→**Data Flow:**
   153→```
   154→URL (/#/company/role)
   155→  → React Router captures params
   156→  → VariantPortfolio.tsx loads variant JSON
   157→  → variants.ts: mergeProfile(base + overrides)
   158→  → VariantContext provides merged profile
   159→  → Portfolio.tsx receives from context
   160→  → Sections (Hero, About, etc.) receive profile prop
   161→  → Personalized content rendered
   162→```
   163→
   164→**Key Files:**
   165→- `src/context/VariantContext.tsx` - Profile injection system
   166→- `src/pages/VariantPortfolio.tsx` - Dynamic variant loader
   167→- `src/lib/variants.ts` - Loading + merging logic
   168→- `src/types/variant.ts` - Type definitions
   169→- `scripts/generate-cv.ts` - CLI generator (243 lines)
   170→- `content/variants/*.{yaml,json}` - Variant data
   171→
   172→### Variant Schema
   173→
   174→```typescript
   175→interface Variant {
   176→  metadata: {
   177→    company: string;
   178→    role: string;
   179→    slug: string;
   180→    generatedAt: string;
   181→    jobDescription: string;
   182→    generationModel?: string;
   183→  };
   184→  overrides: {
   185→    hero?: {
   186→      status?: string;
   187→      headline?: HeadlineSegment[];
   188→      subheadline?: string;
   189→    };
   190→    about?: {
   191→      tagline?: string;
   192→      bio?: string[];
   193→      stats?: Stat[];
   194→    };
   195→    sections?: {
   196→      beyondWork?: boolean;
   197→      blog?: boolean;
   198→      onchainIdentity?: boolean;
   199→      skills?: boolean;
   200→      passionProjects?: boolean;
   201→    };
   202→  };
   203→  relevance?: {
   204→    caseStudies?: Array<{ slug: string; relevanceScore: number; reasoning?: string }>;
   205→    skills?: Array<{ category: string; relevanceScore: number }>;
   206→    projects?: Array<{ slug: string; relevanceScore: number; reasoning?: string }>;
   207→  };
   208→}
   209→```
   210→
   211→### Creating Variants
   212→
   213→**CLI Generator:**
   214→```bash
   215→npm run generate:cv -- \
   216→  --company "Company" \
   217→  --role "Role Title" \
   218→  --jd "./job-description.txt" \
   219→  --provider gemini
   220→```
   221→
   222→**Supported Providers:**
   223→- Claude (Anthropic): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   224→- OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   225→- Gemini (Google): `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   226→
   227→### Component Integration
   228→
   229→**IMPORTANT**: Sections that show personalized content MUST receive `profile` as a prop:
   230→
   231→```tsx
   232→// ✅ CORRECT - Receives profile from context
   233→function HeroSection({ profile, isMobile }: { profile: Profile; isMobile: boolean }) {
   234→  const { hero } = profile;  // Uses variant profile
   235→  // ...
   236→}
   237→
   238→// ❌ INCORRECT - Direct import bypasses variants
   239→import { profile } from '../lib/content';
   240→function HeroSection({ isMobile }: { isMobile: boolean }) {
   241→  const { hero } = profile;  // Always uses base profile!
   242→  // ...
   243→}
   244→```
   245→
   246→**Updated Components:**
   247→- `HeroSection.tsx` - Receives `profile` prop
   248→- `AboutSection.tsx` - Receives `profile` prop
   249→- `CertificationsSection.tsx` - Receives `profile` prop
   250→
   251→**In Portfolio.tsx:**
   252→```tsx
   253→const { profile } = useVariant();  // Get from context
   254→
   255→<HeroSection profile={profile} isMobile={isMobile} ... />
   256→<AboutSection profile={profile} isMobile={isMobile} ... />
   257→```
   258→
   259→### Routing
   260→
   261→**HashRouter** (GitHub Pages compatible):
   262→```tsx
   263→// src/App.tsx
   264→<HashRouter>
   265→  <Routes>
   266→    <Route path="/" element={<BasePortfolio />} />
   267→    <Route path="/:company/:role" element={<VariantPortfolio />} />
   268→  </Routes>
   269→</HashRouter>
   270→```
   271→
   272→**Why Hash Routing?**
   273→- GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side redirects
   274→- Hash URLs (`/#/company/role`) handled client-side
   275→- Fully shareable and bookmarkable
   276→- Can switch to BrowserRouter on Vercel/Netlify with proper config
   277→
   278→### Build Process
   279→
   280→Variants are bundled as separate chunks for optimal loading:
   281→```
   282→dist/assets/
   283→├── bloomberg-technical-product-manager-[hash].js  (4KB)
   284→├── gensyn-technical-product-manager-[hash].js     (4KB)
   285→└── index-[hash].js                                (main bundle)
   286→```
   287→
   288→Vite's `import.meta.glob` enables lazy loading:
   289→```typescript
   290→const variantFiles = import.meta.glob('../../content/variants/*.json', {
   291→  eager: false  // Lazy load only when needed
   292→});
   293→```
   294→

   304→YAML is canonical → JSON is derived
   305→Facts live in knowledge base → Variants reference them
   306→Every claim must be traceable → Machine-checkable ledger
   307→```
   308→
   309→### Quality Scripts
   310→
   311→| Script | Purpose | Command |
   312→|--------|---------|---------|
   313→| `sync-variants.ts` | YAML→JSON sync | `npm run variants:sync` |
   314→| `evaluate-variants.ts` | Generate claims ledger | `npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug>` |
   315→| `redteam.ts` | Adversarial scanning | `npm run redteam:variant -- --slug <slug>` |
   316→
   317→### Build Integration
   318→
   319→```json
   320→"predev": "npm run variants:sync",
   321→"prebuild": "npm run validate && npm run variants:sync"
   322→```
   323→
   324→Every `npm run dev` and `npm run build` now enforces YAML/JSON parity.
   325→
   326→### Knowledge Base
   327→
   328→```
   329→content/knowledge/
   330→├── index.yaml           # Entity graph
   331→├── achievements/        # STAR-format: Situation, Task, Action, Result
   332→│   ├── ankr-15x-revenue.yaml
   333→│   ├── eth-staking-zero-slashing.yaml
   334→│   └── ...
   335→└── stories/             # Extended narratives
   336→```
   337→
   338→**Golden Rule**: Fix facts in the knowledge base, not in the variant output.
   339→
   340→### Claims Ledger
   341→
   342→For each variant, the evaluation script extracts metric-like claims and generates:
   343→- `capstone/develop/evals/<slug>.claims.yaml` — Machine-checkable
   344→- `capstone/develop/evals/<slug>.eval.md` — Human checklist
   345→
   346→```bash
   347→npm run eval:variant -- --slug bloomberg-technical-product-manager
   348→npm run eval:check  # Fails if unverified claims
   349→```
   350→
   351→### Red Team Checks
   352→
   353→| Check ID | Catches |
   354→|----------|---------|
   355→| `RT-SEC-SECRETS` | API keys, tokens |
   356→| `RT-SEC-CONFIDENTIAL` | NDA language |
   357→| `RT-TONE-SYCOPHANCY` | "thrilled", "dream company" |
   358→| `RT-ACC-INFLATION` | "about 15×" near metrics |
   359→| `RT-XVAR-CONTAM` | Mentions other target company |
   360→
   361→```bash
   362→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug bloomberg-technical-product-manager
   363→npm run redteam:check --strict  # WARN = FAIL
   364→```
   365→
   366→### PM Workflow
   367→
   368→Work one variant at a time through the pipeline:
   369→1. `npm run variants:sync`
   370→2. `npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug>`
   371→3. Verify claims in `*.claims.yaml`
   372→4. `npm run eval:check`
   373→5. `npm run redteam:variant -- --slug <slug>`
   374→6. `npm run redteam:check`
   375→7. Fix KB or variant wording until clean
   376→8. Commit + deploy

   423→
   424→### Design System Migration
   425→
   426→**Objective**: Migrate from React context-based colors to CSS custom properties
   427→
   428→**Changes Made:**
   429→1. Created `src/styles/globals.css` with all design tokens
   430→2. Updated `ThemeContext.tsx` to set `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`
   431→3. Migrated 8 components to use CSS variables instead of `useTheme().colors`:
   432→   - ThemeToggle.tsx
   433→   - FooterSection.tsx
   434→   - HeroSection.tsx
   435→   - AboutSection.tsx
   436→   - SocialSection.tsx
   437→   - ExperienceSection.tsx
   438→   - CertificationsSection.tsx
   439→   - CaseStudyModal.tsx
   440→
   441→**Git Commits:**
   442→- `34a925e` - feat: migrate design system to CSS custom properties
   443→- `1d5668e` - test: add design system test suite with Vitest
   444→
   445→---
   446→
   447→## Important Conventions
   448→
   449→### DO ✅
   450→
   451→- Use CSS variables for all colors: `var(--color-*)`
   452→- Use spacing tokens: `var(--space-md)` not `16px`
   453→- Use font variables: `var(--font-serif)` not hardcoded strings
   454→- Run `npm run test:design-system` after design changes
   455→
   456→### DON'T ❌
   457→
   458→- Import `colors` from `useTheme()` - this is deprecated
   459→- Use hardcoded hex colors in components
   460→- Use `isDark` conditionals for colors (CSS handles this now)
   461→
   462→---
   463→
   464→## Dependencies
   465→
   466→**Core:**
   467→- react@19.2.0
   468→- react-dom@19.2.0
   469→- vite@7.2.4
   470→
   471→**Dev/Testing:**
   472→- vitest@3.2.4
   473→- @testing-library/react
   474→- @testing-library/jest-dom
   475→- jsdom
   476→

    11→- ✨ **Smooth Animations**: Premium easing and transitions
    12→- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop optimized
    13→
    14→## 🚨 Governance ("The Prime Directive")
    15→**The Design System is the Single Source of Truth.**
    16→*   **Do not** use hardcoded values in components.
    17→*   **Do not** add "snowflake" styles without justification.
    18→*   **Updates**: If you need a new style, add it to `globals.css` AND document it here first.
    19→
    20→## Quick Start
    21→
    22→### Theme System
    23→
    24→The design system uses CSS custom properties for theming. Toggle between dark and light modes using the `ThemeToggle` component.
    25→
    26→```tsx
    27→import { ThemeProvider } from './context/ThemeContext';
    28→
    29→function App() {
    30→  return (
    31→    <ThemeProvider>
    32→      {/* Your app content */}
    33→    </ThemeProvider>
    34→  );
    35→}
    36→```
    37→
    38→### Using Components
    39→
    40→All components are available in the `/components` directory:
    41→
    42→```tsx
    43→import { Button } from './components/Button';
    44→import { Tag } from './components/Tag';
    45→import { CaseStudyCard } from './components/CaseStudyCard';
    46→
    47→// Primary button
    48→<Button variant="primary" href="#contact">Get in touch</Button>
    49→
    50→// Secondary button
    51→<Button variant="secondary" href="#work">View work</Button>
    52→

   153→## 🎯 Hired-on-Sight Polish (Target: 9/10)
   154→
   155→### 1. Trust Battery (Testimonials)
   156→To convey seniority, testimonials must move beyond a simple list:
   157→- **Layout**: "Wall of Love" (Staggered Masonry Grid).
   158→- **Typography**: 1-2 featured testimonials as large pull-quotes.
   159→- **Motion**: Staggered entrance animations using `AnimatePresence`.
   160→
   161→### 2. Light Mode Refinement
   162→Light mode must not feel like an afterthought:
   163→- **Elevation**: Increase `box-shadow` opacity to `0.08` for cards.
   164→- **Vibrancy**: Boost ambient orb opacity to `0.20`.
   165→- **Polish**: Add a subtle 1px border (`var(--color-separator)`) to cards in light mode for definition.
   166→
   167→---
   168→
   169→### Case Study Links

   183→- **Styling**: Consistent border outline style (no solid fills)
   184→
   185→#### Supported Media Types
   186→| Type | Icon | Use for |

   325→Defined in `globals.css` to ensure consistency across all sections.
   326→
   327→### Dimensions
   328→
   329→- `--layout-max-width`: **1600px** (Wide, premium feel)
   330→- `--nav-height`: **20px** (Compact desktop vertical padding)
   331→- `--nav-height-mobile`: **16px** (Mobile vertical padding)
   332→- `--drawer-width`: **800px** (Case Study slide-over width)
   333→- `--drawer-z-index`: **200** (Above all content)
   334→- `--omnibar-z-index`: **90** (Floating above content, below nav/drawer)
   335→- `--omnibar-height`: **56px** (Standard touch target height)
   336→- `--omnibar-bottom-spacing`: **24px** (Distance from bottom)
   337→
   338→### Usage
   339→
   340→```css
   341→.section-container {
   342→  max-width: var(--layout-max-width);
   343→  margin: 0 auto;
   344→}
   345→```
   346→
   347→## Effects
   348→
   349→### Grid Overlay
   350→Subtle dot grid background:
   351→
   352→```tsx
   353→<div className="bg-grid" />
   354→```
   355→
   356→### Ambient Orbs
   357→Decorative gradient effects:
   358→
   359→```tsx
   360→<div className="orb-primary" />
   361→<div className="orb-secondary" />
   362→```
   363→
   364→## Best Practices
   365→
   366→1. **Always use CSS variables** for colors and spacing
   367→2. **Use semantic component names** for clarity
   368→3. **Maintain consistent spacing** using the token system
   369→4. **Test both themes** when adding new components
   370→5. **Follow responsive patterns** established in the system
   371→6. **Use proper semantic HTML** for accessibility
   372→7. **Leverage the easing functions** for consistent animations
   373→
   374→## Customization
   375→
   376→### Changing Colors
   377→
   378→Edit the CSS variables in `/styles/globals.css`:
   379→
   380→```css
   381→:root {
   382→  --color-accent: #your-color;
   383→}
   384→
   385→[data-theme="light"] {
   386→  --color-accent: #your-light-color;
   387→}
   388→```
   389→
   390→### Adding New Components
   391→
   392→1. Create component in `/components`
   393→2. Add styles to `/components/components.css`
   394→3. Use existing design tokens
   395→4. Test in both themes
   396→5. Ensure responsive behavior

     1→# PROJECT CONTEXT — Capstone Quality Pipeline Handoff
     2→## For Claude / future assistants working on this repo
     3→
     4→Dmitrii’s intent (capstone): build real muscle in **Red Teaming**, **Evaluations**, and **AI Product Lifecycle** by turning a fast-grown “vibecoded” portfolio project into a **repeatable, auditable system**.
     5→
     6→This handoff summarizes what was added/changed so you can continue without having the chat history.
     7→
     8→---
     9→
    10→## What was built (high-level)
    11→
    12→This repo already had:
    13→- a portfolio site (Vite + React)
    14→- structured content in `content/`
    15→- a “Universal CV” concept: generate **variants** tailored to a job
    16→
    17→The capstone upgrade is: **make quality checks executable**.
    18→
    19→We implemented:
    20→
    21→1) **Variants coherence**: YAML is canonical, JSON is runtime  
    22→2) **Executable evaluation**: “claims ledger” that makes factual traceability machine-checkable  
    23→3) **Executable red team**: repeatable scan + report per variant
    24→
    25→---
    26→
    27→## The architecture (mental model)
    28→
    29→### Artifact flow (canonical → runtime)
    30→
    31→- **Canonical (human/agent edits):** `content/variants/<slug>.yaml`
    32→- **Runtime (site loads):** `content/variants/<slug>.json`
    33→
    34→The site loads JSON via Vite glob import:
    35→
    36→- `src/lib/variants.ts` uses `import.meta.glob('../../content/variants/*.json')`
    37→
    38→So JSON must exist and must match YAML.
    39→
    40→### Quality pipeline (capstone)
    41→
    42→```
    43→Truth (content/knowledge/**)
    44→   ↓
    45→Variant (content/variants/*.yaml)
    46→   ↓  variants:sync
    47→Runtime artifact (content/variants/*.json)
    48→   ↓  eval:variant
    49→Claims ledger (capstone/develop/evals/*.claims.yaml)
    50→   ↓  redteam:variant
    51→Red team report (capstone/develop/redteam/*.redteam.md)
    52→   ↓
    53→Ship (deploy)
    54→```
    55→
    56→---
    57→
    58→## Code added (scripts)
    59→
    60→### 1) Variant sync
    61→**File:** `scripts/sync-variants.ts`  
    62→**Purpose:** generate deterministic JSON from YAML; detect drift
    63→
    64→Commands:
    65→- `npm run variants:sync`
    66→- `npm run variants:check`
    67→
    68→### 2) Executable evaluation
    69→**File:** `scripts/evaluate-variants.ts`  
    70→**Purpose:**
    71→- extract **metric-like claims** from variant overrides
    72→- suggest candidate sources from `content/knowledge/**`
    73→- write a claims ledger + human checklist
    74→- enforce machine-checkable gates
    75→
    76→Commands:
    77→- `npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug>`
    78→- `npm run eval:all`
    79→- `npm run eval:check`
    80→
    81→Artifacts:
    82→- `capstone/develop/evals/<slug>.claims.yaml`
    83→- `capstone/develop/evals/<slug>.eval.md`
    84→
    85→Write-back helper (optional):
    86→- `npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug> --verify <claimId>=<sourcePath>`
    87→
    88→### 3) Executable red team
    89→**File:** `scripts/redteam.ts`  
    90→**Purpose:** scan variant content for portfolio-relevant risks
    91→
    92→Commands:
    93→- `npm run redteam:variant -- --slug <slug>`
    94→- `npm run redteam:all`
    95→- `npm run redteam:check`
    96→- `npm run redteam:check -- --strict`
    97→
    98→Artifact:
    99→- `capstone/develop/redteam/<slug>.redteam.md`
   100→
   101→---
   102→
   103→## Key bug fix
   104→
   105→**File:** `src/lib/variants.ts`  
   106→**Fix:** `getVariantSlugs()` was incorrectly matching `*.yaml` even though variants are loaded from `*.json`. It now matches `*.json`.
   107→
   108→---
   109→
   110→## Small safety upgrade in generator
   111→
   112→**File:** `scripts/generate-cv.ts`
   113→
   114→Changes:
   115→- job description in the prompt is now labeled **UNTRUSTED INPUT** and wrapped in `<JOB_DESCRIPTION>...</JOB_DESCRIPTION>` (prompt-injection hygiene)
   116→- printed URLs now correctly use HashRouter: `/#/company/role`
   117→- it reminds to run `npm run variants:sync`
   118→
   119→---
   120→
   121→## Capstone docs added/updated
   122→
   123→New:
   124→- `capstone/develop/executable-quality-pipeline.md`
   125→- `capstone/develop/evals/README.md`
   126→- `capstone/develop/redteam/README.md`
   127→
   128→Updated:
   129→- `capstone/develop/evaluation.md` now references the CLI
   130→- `capstone/develop/red-teaming.md` now references the CLI
   131→
   132→---
   133→
   134→## package.json changes (new commands)
   135→
   136→Added scripts:
   137→- `predev`: `npm run variants:sync`
   138→- `prebuild`: `npm run validate && npm run variants:sync`
   139→- `variants:*`, `eval:*`, `redteam:*`
   140→
   141→---
   142→
   143→## Mentor notes for Dmitrii (what to internalize)
   144→
   145→### 1) Treat “evaluation” as a product behavior
   146→Not a doc. Not vibes. A behavior you can rerun and gate.
   147→
   148→The claims ledger is the key muscle:
   149→- extract claims
   150→- verify against sources
   151→- anchors make it regression-proof
   152→
   153→### 2) Know your trust boundaries
   154→- Knowledge base = trusted (facts)
   155→- Job descriptions = untrusted (can contain prompt injection or nonsense)
   156→- Variant output is publishable, so it must be defensible
   157→
   158→### 3) Don’t fix facts in the output
   159→If you catch a mismatch:
   160→- fix the source of truth (knowledge files) OR remove the claim
   161→- then regenerate / re-evaluate
   162→
   163→### 4) Keep scope tight
   164→This capstone is about:
   165→- evals
   166→- red teaming
   167→- lifecycle gates
   168→
   169→Not about building a full agent platform.
   170→
   171→---
   172→
   173→## Suggested next moves (if continuing)
   174→
   175→1) Run `npm run eval:all`
   176→2) Pick one variant and verify **every claim** in its ledger
   177→3) Run `npm run redteam:variant -- --slug <slug>`
   178→4) Only then consider CI gating (optional): `eval:check` + `redteam:check`
   179→
   180→

   254→```bash
   255→# Count existing + 1
   256→ls content/case-studies/*.md | wc -l
   257→# Next ID = count + 1
   258→```
   259→
   260→**Passion Projects:**

   262→# Find highest ID
   263→grep 'id:' content/passion-projects/index.yaml | sort -n | tail -1
   264→# Add 1
   265→```
   266→
   267→### Toggle Section Visibility
   268→
   269→Edit `content/profile.yaml`:
   270→```yaml
   271→sections:
   272→  beyondWork: false
   273→  blog: true           # Show/hide blog section
   274→  onchainIdentity: false
   275→  skills: false
   276→  passionProjects: true  # Show/hide passion projects
   277→```
   278→
   279→### Update Profile Stats
   280→
   281→Edit `content/profile.yaml`:
   282→```yaml
   283→about:
   284→  stats:
   285→    - value: "8+"
   286→      label: "Years in Product"
   287→    - value: "5"
   288→      label: "Years in Web3"
   289→```
   290→
   291→### Add Social Link
   292→
   293→Edit `content/social/index.yaml`:
   294→```yaml
   295→links:
   296→  - platform: GitHub
   297→    label: "@username"
   298→    url: https://github.com/username
   299→    icon: github
   300→    primary: true
   301→```
   302→
   303→---
   304→
   305→## Best Practices
   306→
   307→### Content Writing
   308→
   309→1. **Headlines** - One sentence, active voice, metric-driven
   310→2. **Slugs** - Lowercase, hyphens, descriptive
   311→3. **Tags** - 3-5 relevant tags, consistent naming
   312→4. **Metrics** - Specific numbers, context-aware labels
   313→5. **Images** - Store in `/public/images/`, reference as `/images/name.png`
   314→
   315→### File Organization
   316→
   317→```
   318→content/
   319→├── _templates/          # Templates (don't edit originals)
   320→├── case-studies/        # One file per case study
   321→│   ├── 01-project.md
   322→│   └── 02-project.md
   323→├── blog/                # Date-prefixed files
   324→│   └── YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
   325→└── passion-projects/
   326→    └── index.yaml       # All projects in one file
   327→```
   328→
   329→### Validation Workflow
   330→
   331→```bash
   332→# 1. Make changes
   333→vim content/case-studies/05-new-project.md
   334→
   335→# 2. Validate
   336→npm run validate
   337→
   338→# 3. Fix errors if any
   339→# 4. Preview locally
   340→npm run dev
   341→
   342→# 5. Commit
   343→git add content/
   344→git commit -m "Add new case study"
   345→```
   346→
   347→---
   348→
   349→## Troubleshooting
   350→
   351→### Validation Errors
   352→
   353→**"Required field missing"**
   354→- Check template for required fields
   355→- Ensure no typos in field names
   356→
   357→**"Invalid date format"**
   358→- Dates must be `YYYY-MM-DD`
   359→- Wrap in quotes: `"2024-12-15"`
   360→
   361→**"Invalid year format"**
   362→- Use `2024` or `2024-25` format
   363→- No other formats accepted
   364→
   365→**"Frontmatter parse error"**
   366→- Check YAML syntax
   367→- Ensure proper indentation (2 spaces)
   368→- Quotes around strings with special chars
   369→
   370→### Build Errors
   371→
   372→**"Cannot find module"**
   373→- File might be outside `content/` directory
   374→- Check file paths in frontmatter
   375→
   376→**"Zod validation failed"**
   377→- Run `npm run validate` for details
   378→- Fix indicated fields
   379→
   380→### Hot Reload Not Working
   381→
   382→```bash
   383→# Restart dev server
   384→npm run dev
   385→```
   386→
   387→---
   388→
   389→## Advanced
   390→
   391→### Custom Validation
   392→
   393→Schemas are in `src/lib/schemas.ts`. To add custom validation:
   394→
   395→```typescript
   396→// Add to existing schema
   397→export const CustomSchema = z.object({
   398→  field: z.string().min(10).max(100),
   399→  url: z.string().url(),
   400→  email: z.string().email()
   401→});
   402→```
   403→
   404→### Pre-commit Hook
   405→
   406→Add validation to git hooks (optional):
   407→
   408→```bash
   409→# .git/hooks/pre-commit
   410→#!/bin/sh
   411→npm run validate || exit 1
   412→```
   413→

   198→## Personalization Strategy
   199→
   200→### What Gets Personalized
   201→
   202→✅ **Hero Section**
   203→- Status line (role type emphasis)
   204→- Headline (key value proposition)
   205→- Subheadline (tailored elevator pitch)
   206→
   207→✅ **About Section**
   208→- Tagline (professional summary)
   209→- Bio paragraphs (career narrative)
   210→- Stats (metrics that matter for role)
   211→
   212→✅ **Section Visibility**
   213→- Show/hide sections based on job fit
   214→- Example: Show onchain identity for Web3 roles, hide for traditional tech
   215→
   216→✅ **Content Ordering**
   217→- Case studies ranked by relevance
   218→- Skills emphasized by category
   219→- Projects highlighted by fit
   220→
   221→### What Stays Consistent
   222→
   223→❌ **Factual Content**
   224→- Case study text unchanged
   225→- Experience details unchanged
   226→- All achievements remain truthful
   227→
   228→❌ **Design & Brand**
   229→- Same visual design system
   230→- Same navigation and UX
   231→- Same color scheme and typography
   232→
   233→---
   234→
   235→## Best Practices
   236→
   237→### 1. Gather Comprehensive Info
   238→
   239→Before generating:
   240→- Full job description
   241→- Company values/culture research
   242→- Specific technologies mentioned
   243→- Role emphasis (technical vs. strategic vs. people leadership)
   244→
   245→### 2. Review & Refine
   246→
   247→After generation:
   248→- Review hero headline for impact
   249→- Ensure bio flows naturally
   250→- Verify stats are relevant
   251→- Check section visibility makes sense
   252→
   253→### 3. Test Before Sharing
   254→
   255→```bash
   256→# Local testing
   257→npm run dev
   258→# Visit: http://localhost:5173/#/company/role
   259→
   260→# Validate content
   261→npm run validate
   262→
   263→# Build for production
   264→npm run build
   265→```
   266→
   267→### 4. Naming Conventions
   268→
   269→**Slugs:** Use lowercase with hyphens
   270→- ✅ `bloomberg-technical-product-manager`
   271→- ❌ `Bloomberg_Technical_Product_Manager`
   272→
   273→**Files:** Match slug exactly
   274→- `{slug}.yaml` - Human-readable source
   275→- `{slug}.json` - Client-side loading
   276→
   277→---
   278→
   279→## Editing Existing Variants
   280→
   281→### Update YAML Source
   282→
   283→```bash
   284→# Edit the human-readable YAML
   285→vim content/variants/bloomberg-technical-product-manager.yaml
   286→
   287→# Regenerate JSON
   288→npx tsx -e "
   289→import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs';
   290→import YAML from 'yaml';
   291→const yaml = readFileSync('content/variants/bloomberg-technical-product-manager.yaml', 'utf-8');
   292→writeFileSync('content/variants/bloomberg-technical-product-manager.json',
   293→  JSON.stringify(YAML.parse(yaml), null, 2));
   294→"
   295→
   296→# Validate
   297→npm run validate
   298→
   299→# Test
   300→npm run dev
   301→```
   302→
   303→---
   304→
   305→## Deployment
   306→
   307→### GitHub Pages (Current Setup)
   308→
   309→Using HashRouter for client-side routing:
   310→
   311→```bash
   312→# Merge PR
   313→git checkout main
   314→git pull origin main
   315→
   316→# GitHub Pages auto-deploys
   317→
   318→# Test live URLs
   319→https://edgeoftrust.com/#/bloomberg/technical-product-manager
   320→https://edgeoftrust.com/#/gensyn/technical-product-manager
   321→```
   322→
   323→### Alternative Hosting
   324→
   325→For **Vercel/Netlify** (clean URLs without hash):
   326→
   327→1. Switch back to BrowserRouter in `src/App.tsx`
   328→2. Add rewrites config (see section below)
   329→3. Deploy
   330→
   331→**Vercel** (`vercel.json`):
   332→```json
   333→{
   334→  "rewrites": [
   335→    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
   336→  ]
   337→}
   338→```
   339→
   340→**Netlify** (`netlify.toml`):
   341→```toml
   342→[[redirects]]
   343→  from = "/*"
   344→  to = "/index.html"
   345→  status = 200
   346→```
   347→
   348→---
   349→
   350→## Troubleshooting
   351→
   352→### Variant Not Loading
   353→
   354→**Issue:** Variant URL shows base portfolio
   355→
   356→**Checks:**
   357→1. ✅ JSON file exists: `content/variants/{slug}.json`
   358→2. ✅ Slug matches URL: `/#/company/role` → `company-role.json`
   359→3. ✅ File validates: `npm run validate`
   360→4. ✅ Build includes variant: Check `dist/assets/` for variant chunk
   361→
   362→**Debug:**
   363→```bash
   364→# Check if variant file exists
   365→ls -la content/variants/
   366→
   367→# Validate schema
   368→npm run validate
   369→
   370→# Check build output
   371→npm run build | grep "technical-product-manager"
   372→
   373→# Test locally
   374→npm run dev
   375→# Open browser console at /#/company/role
   376→```
   377→
   378→### Sections Not Personalizing
   379→
   380→**Issue:** Hero/About look the same as base
   381→
   382→**Fix:** Ensure sections receive profile prop (fixed in latest version)
   383→
   384→**Verify:**
   385→```tsx
   386→// src/components/Portfolio.tsx
   387→<HeroSection profile={profile} ... />  // ✅ Has profile prop
   388→<HeroSection ... />  // ❌ Missing profile prop
   389→```
   390→
   391→### 404 on Variant URLs
   392→
   393→**Issue:** URLs return 404
   394→
   395→**Fix:** Using HashRouter for GitHub Pages
   396→- URLs must include `#`: `/#/company/role`
   397→- Not: `/company/role` (clean URLs need server config)
   398→
   399→---
   400→
   401→## Example Variants
   402→
   403→### Bloomberg - Platform Architecture Focus
   404→
   405→**Emphasis:**
   406→- SDK/framework development
   407→- Developer productivity tools
   408→- Technical platform standards
   409→
   410→**Hero:** "Building developer platforms at the intersection of scale and innovation"
   411→
   412→**Stats:** Platform PM experience, SDK products, developer tools
   413→
   414→### Gensyn - Web3 + ML Infrastructure Focus

   420→
   421→**Hero:** "Building at the intersection of AI and decentralized systems"
   422→
   423→**Stats:** Web3 experience, protocol integrations, developer SDKs
   424→
   425→---
   426→
   427→## Future Enhancements
   428→
   429→### Phase 2: Recruiter View
   430→
   431→Allow recruiters to check candidate fit:
   432→
   433→```
   434→/#/check?jd=base64_encoded_jd
   435→```
   436→
   437→Shows:
   438→- Match score
   439→- Relevant case studies highlighted
   440→- Skill alignment
   441→- Culture fit indicators
   442→
   443→### Phase 3: Dynamic Generation
   444→
   445→Generate variants on-the-fly without pre-building:
   446→
   447→```
   448→/#/custom?company=X&role=Y
   449→```
   450→
   451→With serverless function for AI generation.

    32→```
    33→
    34→---
    35→
    36→## Step 1: Sync Variants
    37→
    38→**Purpose**: Convert YAML (human-editable) to JSON (runtime artifact).
    39→
    40→```bash
    41→npm run variants:sync
    42→```
    43→
    44→**What happens**:
    45→- Reads all `content/variants/*.yaml` files
    46→- Validates against Zod schema
    47→- Writes `content/variants/*.json` files
    48→
    49→**Check for drift**:
    50→```bash
    51→npm run variants:check
    52→```
    53→Fails if JSON doesn't match YAML (useful in CI).
    54→
    55→**Output**: JSON files in `content/variants/`
    56→
    57→---
    58→
    59→## Step 2: Generate Claims Ledger
    60→
    61→**Purpose**: Extract all metric-like claims and find candidate sources.
    62→
    63→```bash
    64→npm run eval:variant -- --slug mysten-walrus-senior-pm
    65→```
    66→
    67→**What happens**:
    68→1. Parses the variant YAML
    69→2. Extracts claims containing metrics (%, $, ×, numbers)
    70→3. Searches knowledge base for matching sources
    71→4. Generates a claims ledger with candidate sources
    72→
    73→**Outputs created**:
    74→- `capstone/develop/evals/mysten-walrus-senior-pm.claims.yaml` - Machine-readable ledger
    75→- `capstone/develop/evals/mysten-walrus-senior-pm.eval.md` - Human checklist
    76→
    77→### Understanding the Claims Ledger
    78→
    79→Open `capstone/develop/evals/<slug>.claims.yaml`:
    80→
    81→```yaml
    82→claims:
    83→  - id: metric-1080fe1903
    84→    location: overrides.hero.subheadline    # Where in variant
    85→    text: "Senior PM with 8 years..."       # The claim text
    86→    anchors:
    87→      - 8 years                              # Key metric extracted
    88→    candidateSources:
    89→      - path: content/knowledge/achievements/...
    90→        score: 0.09
    91→        matchedAnchors: []
    92→        note: "anchors 0/1 • overlap 60%"
    93→    verified:
    94→      status: unverified                     # YOU EDIT THIS
    95→      sources: []
    96→      notes: ""
    97→```
    98→
    99→### Verifying Claims
   100→
   101→For each claim, you need to:
   102→
   103→1. **Check candidate sources** - Does a knowledge base file contain this fact?
   104→2. **Update verified status** - Change `unverified` → `verified`
   105→3. **Add source path** - Reference the KB file that proves the claim
   106→4. **Add notes** - Optional context
   107→
   108→**Example: Before**
   109→```yaml
   110→verified:
   111→  status: unverified
   112→  sources: []
   113→  notes: ""
   114→```
   115→
   116→**Example: After**
   117→```yaml
   118→verified:
   119→  status: verified
   120→  sources:
   121→    - content/knowledge/achievements/l2-protocol-integrations.yaml
   122→  notes: "Anchor '7+ L2 integrations' matches KB exactly"
   123→```
   124→
   125→### If a claim has no source
   126→
   127→Two options:
   128→
   129→1. **Add to knowledge base** - Create/update a file in `content/knowledge/achievements/`
   130→2. **Reword the variant** - Change the claim in `content/variants/<slug>.yaml`
   131→
   132→**Golden Rule**: Fix facts in the knowledge base first, then regenerate.
   133→
   134→---
   135→
   136→## Step 3: Red Team Scan
   137→
   138→**Purpose**: Adversarial checks for security, tone, and accuracy risks.
   139→
   140→```bash
   141→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug mysten-walrus-senior-pm
   142→```
   143→
   144→**What happens**: Runs 8 checks against your variant:
   145→
   146→| Check | Severity | What It Catches |
   147→|-------|----------|-----------------|
   148→| `RT-ACC-CLAIMS` | FAIL | Missing/unverified claims ledger |
   149→| `RT-SEC-SECRETS` | FAIL | API keys, tokens in text |
   150→| `RT-SEC-CONFIDENTIAL` | FAIL | NDA/confidential language |

   160→
   161→**RT-ACC-CLAIMS (most common)**:
   162→```
   163→FAIL: Missing ledger
   164→Fix: npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug>

   166→```
   167→
   168→**RT-TONE-SYCOPHANCY**:
   169→```
   170→WARN: "thrilled", "dream company" detected
   171→Fix: Edit content/variants/<slug>.yaml

   183→## Step 4: Gate Check (CI Mode)
   184→
   185→**Purpose**: Pass/fail gate for deployment.
   186→
   187→```bash
   188→# Check all variants pass evaluation
   189→npm run eval:check
   190→
   191→# Check all variants pass red team (WARN ok)
   192→npm run redteam:check
   193→
   194→# Strict mode (WARN = FAIL)
   195→npm run redteam:check -- --strict
   196→```
   197→
   198→**Exit codes**:
   199→- `0` = All checks pass
   200→- `1` = At least one failure

   204→## Complete Example: mysten-walrus-senior-pm
   205→
   206→### 1. Sync
   207→
   208→```bash
   209→npm run variants:sync
   210→```
   211→```
   212→✓ mysten-walrus-senior-pm (in sync)
   213→```
   214→
   215→### 2. Evaluate
   216→
   217→```bash
   218→npm run eval:variant -- --slug mysten-walrus-senior-pm
   219→```
   220→```
   221→✓ mysten-walrus-senior-pm: 5 claims, 0 verified, 5 unverified
   222→  capstone/develop/evals/mysten-walrus-senior-pm.claims.yaml
   223→```
   224→
   225→### 3. Verify Claims
   226→
   227→Open `capstone/develop/evals/mysten-walrus-senior-pm.claims.yaml`
   228→
   229→For each claim:
   230→1. Check if `candidateSources` has a good match (score > 0.5)
   231→2. Verify the anchor text matches the KB file
   232→3. Update `verified.status` to `verified`
   233→4. Add the source path
   234→
   235→### 4. Red Team
   236→
   237→```bash
   238→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug mysten-walrus-senior-pm
   239→```
   240→```
   241→✗ mysten-walrus-senior-pm 1 FAIL 0 WARN
   242→```
   243→
   244→Check `capstone/develop/redteam/mysten-walrus-senior-pm.redteam.md`:
   245→```
   246→RT-ACC-CLAIMS: FAIL - Missing/unverified claims
   247→```
   248→
   249→### 5. Fix & Iterate
   250→
   251→Fix unverified claims → Re-run eval → Re-run redteam → Repeat until clean.
   252→
   253→### 6. Final Gate
   254→
   255→```bash
   256→npm run eval:check && npm run redteam:check
   257→```
   258→```
   259→✓ All variants pass
   260→```
   261→
   262→---
   263→
   264→## Adding New Knowledge Base Entries
   265→
   266→If a claim has no source, add it to the knowledge base:
   267→
   268→```bash
   269→# Create new achievement file
   270→touch content/knowledge/achievements/my-new-achievement.yaml
   271→```
   272→
   273→**Template** (`content/knowledge/achievements/*.yaml`):
   274→```yaml
   275→id: my-new-achievement
   276→type: achievement
   277→title: "Short descriptive title"
   278→company: Company Name
   279→timeframe: "2023-2024"
   280→situation: |
   281→  Brief context (STAR format)
   282→task: |
   283→  What needed to be done
   284→action: |
   285→  What you specifically did
   286→result: |
   287→  Quantified outcomes
   288→metrics:
   289→  - value: "15×"
   290→    label: "revenue increase"
   291→    context: "Year-over-year growth"
   292→tags:
   293→  - web3
   294→  - infrastructure
   295→```
   296→
   297→After adding, re-run evaluation to pick up the new source.
   298→
   299→---
   300→
   301→## JSON Output for Automation
   302→
   303→All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output:
   304→
   305→```bash
   306→npm run variants:sync -- --json
   307→npm run eval:variant -- --slug mysten-walrus-senior-pm --json
   308→npm run redteam:all -- --json
   309→```
   310→
   311→Useful for CI pipelines:
   312→```bash
   313→npm run redteam:all -- --json | jq '.errors | length'
   314→```
   315→
   316→---
   317→
   318→## Troubleshooting
   319→
   320→### "Variant YAML not found"
   321→Check the slug matches the filename:
   322→```bash
   323→ls content/variants/*.yaml
   324→```
   325→
   326→### "Claims ledger missing"
   327→Run evaluation first:
   328→```bash
   329→npm run eval:variant -- --slug <slug>
   330→```
   331→
   332→### "All claims unverified"
   333→You need to manually verify each claim in `.claims.yaml`.
   334→The script finds candidates but doesn't auto-verify.
   335→
   336→### "Red team fails on RT-ACC-CLAIMS"
   337→This means claims exist but aren't verified. Open the `.claims.yaml` and update the `verified` sections.
   338→
   339→---
   340→
   341→## Quick Commands Reference
   342→
   343→```bash
   344→# Sync all variants
   345→npm run variants:sync
   346→
   347→# Evaluate one variant
   348→npm run eval:variant -- --slug mysten-walrus-senior-pm
   349→
   350→# Evaluate all variants
   351→npm run eval:all
   352→
   353→# Red team one variant
   354→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug mysten-walrus-senior-pm
   355→
   356→# Red team all variants
   357→npm run redteam:all
   358→
   359→# CI gate checks
   360→npm run eval:check
   361→npm run redteam:check
   362→npm run redteam:check -- --strict
   363→```

<system-reminder>
Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.

     2→title: "Building a Portfolio That Proves Itself"
     3→date: "2024-12-22"
     4→excerpt: "The best portfolio isn't one that looks good—it's one where every claim traces to proof. Here's what I learned building a system that verifies itself."
     5→tags: ["Career", "AI", "Portfolio", "Capstone", "Web3"]
     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Found myself between roles. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*
    10→
    11→I knew two things: I wanted to stay at the intersection of Web3 and AI, and I needed a better way to present my work. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. LinkedIn felt like shouting into the void.
    12→
    13→So I started building. Three months later, I had something unexpected: not just a portfolio, but a system that proves its own claims.
    14→
    15→## The Problem
    16→
    17→Generic portfolios don't convert. Every product manager has "drove growth" and "led cross-functional teams" on their resume. Metrics help, but metrics without sources feel hollow. How do you know those numbers are real?
    18→
    19→And here's the real problem: when you're applying for multiple roles, you need different emphasis. The infrastructure PM variant isn't the Web3 PM variant isn't the developer tools PM variant. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare.
    20→
    21→I wanted something that could generate targeted variants while ensuring every claim was defensible.
    22→
    23→## What I Built
    24→
    25→The system has four layers:
    26→
    27→**Knowledge Base**: Every achievement lives in structured YAML, using STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Each metric traces to a source. No hallucination possible—the AI can only surface what's already documented.
    28→
    29→**Variant Engine**: Takes a job description, matches it against my knowledge base, scores relevance, and generates a customized portfolio. Different stats, different case study ordering, same underlying facts.
    30→
    31→**Quality Pipeline**: This is where it gets interesting. Every variant runs through:
    32→- **Eval**: Extracts claims, finds candidate sources, verifies each metric
    33→- **Red Team**: Scans for sycophantic language, unverified metrics, cross-variant contamination, confidential leaks
    34→
    35→**Skills Ecosystem**: Nine Claude Code skills that codify the workflow. The AI doesn't freelance—it follows documented patterns with human approval gates.
    36→
    37→## The Numbers
    38→
    39→What three months of building produced:
    40→
    41→| Metric | Value |
    42→|--------|-------|
    43→| CSS Variables | 124 (full design system) |
    44→| Initial Bundle | 195KB gzip (59% reduction from 480KB) |
    45→| Claude Code Skills | 9 (knowledge → content → variants) |
    46→| Job-Specific Variants | 9 active |
    47→| Claims Per Variant | ~6 (100% traceable) |
    48→| Red Team Checks | 8 automated gates |
    49→| Tests | 211 passing |
    50→

    38→Liquidations, governance votes, whale movements—every major on-chain event was invisible until it was too late. Traders missed opportunities. Protocols couldn't react fast enough. Communities were always behind.
    39→
    40→## The Challenge
    41→
    42→Blockchains are transparent, but staying ahead of critical events required complex custom setups, constant polling, or expensive infrastructure. No simple way to get real-time notifications about what's happening on-chain.
    43→
    44→The constraints:
    45→- Bootstrapping solo with limited resources
    46→- Multiple chains needed (Ethereum, Cosmos ecosystem)
    47→- Sub-second latency or it's worthless—alerts after the fact are just news
    48→- Developer SDK simple enough for quick integration
    49→
    50→## The Approach

     1→# Strategic Roadmap: Portfolio 2.0
     2→
     3→> **Status**: Draft
     4→> **Owner**: AI Consultant (Antigravity)
     5→> **Goal**: Transform the codebase into a high-conversion, "hired-on-sight" portfolio for a Director-level PM candidate.
     6→
     7→---
     8→
     9→## 1. Quick Wins (High Impact / Low Effort)
    10→
    11→These tasks address immediate blocking issues for content correctness and visibility.
    12→
    13→- [x] **Data Integrity Layer (Critical)**
    14→    - **Problem**: `src/lib/content.ts` uses `as unknown as Type`. Missing YAML fields will cause silent runtime crashes.
    15→    - **Solution**: Install `zod`. Create schemas for `Profile`, `CaseStudy`, etc. Validate YAML import at runtime or build time.
    16→    - **Command**: `npm install zod`
    17→
    18→- [x] **Dynamic SEO (Social Proof)**
    19→    - **Problem**: As a SPA, sharing a Case Study link on LinkedIn currently shows the generic homepage metadata.
    20→    - **Solution**: Install `react-helmet-async`. Update `CaseStudyDrawer` to inject dynamic keys.
    21→    - **Status**: Completed in Phase 2.
    22→
    23→- [x] **Fix Missing Hero Image in Modal**
    24→    - **Problem**: Analysis of `CaseStudyModal.tsx` reveals the "Hero area with image" comment exists, but the actual `<img>` or background render logic is missing or ineffective.
    25→    - **Solution**: Implemented a proper responsive image in `CaseStudyHero.tsx`.
    26→
    27→---
    28→
    29→## 2. Strategic Features (The "Hired" Metric)
    30→
    31→Features designed to prove seniority and competence.
    32→
    33→- [ ] **"Trust Battery" Testimonials Section**
    34→    - **Why**: Social proof is currently buried or static.
    35→    - **Plan**: Implement a "Wall of Love" or Infinite Marquee section on the home page using the compiled reviews from `content/testimonials`.
    36→
    37→- [x] **Floating "Hire Me" Omnibar**
    38→    - **Why**: Conversion path should be always available but unobtrusive.
    39→    - **Plan**: A subtle, glass-morphic floating action bar on mobile (bottom) and desktop (corner) that offers "Resume", "Email", and "Calendly" without needing to scroll to the footer.
    40→    - **Status**: Completed in Phase 2.
    41→
    42→---
    43→
    44→## 3. Design Polish (The "Wow" Factor)
    45→
    46→Elevating the aesthetic from "Clean" to "Premium".
    47→
    48→- [x] **Framer Motion Integration**
    49→    - **Problem**: `CaseStudyModal` uses inline `style={{ animation: ... }}`. This is jerky and lacks exit animations.
    50→    - **Plan**: Replace inline CSS animations with `<AnimatePresence>` and `<motion.div>` in `CaseStudyDrawer`.

## KEY INSIGHTS ABOUT THE PROJECT

1. **Quality-First Architecture**: The portfolio isn't just a website—it's a quality pipeline. Every claim traces to a knowledge base, gets evaluated, and passes red-team checks before deployment.

2. **AI-Powered Automation**: 10 Claude Code skills codify the workflow (content generation, editing, ingestion, evaluation, red-teaming).

3. **Personalization Engine**: Universal CV system generates job-specific variants from a single knowledge base, maintaining factual consistency while optimizing for role fit.

4. **Governance**: Comprehensive documentation of AI agent rules, design system constraints, and validation workflows to maintain consistency.

5. **Three-Month Build**: The blog post (2024-12-22) reveals this entire system was built in ~3 months with remarkable scope: 124 CSS variables, 195KB bundle (59% reduction), 9 variants, 211 tests.

All files are well-organized and serve clear purposes in supporting a production-grade portfolio with AI-assisted personalization and quality assurance.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the project. Let me summarize what I've learned:

## Project Overview
- **Edge of Trust** - Dmitrii Fotesco's professional portfolio
- Universal CV Engine with AI-powered variant generation
- Quality pipeline with eval + red team checks
- 9 active variants for different companies/roles
- Built in ~3 months as a capstone project

## Key Learnings Identified
1. **Distribution Beats Product** - Partnership > features
2. **Customer ≠ User** - Finding the right unit economics
3. **Trust Is Your Moat** - In institutional markets, compliance > performance

## Dmitrii's Writing Style
- Direct and action-oriented
- Warm but professional
- No bullet points in conversational content
- Prose over lists
- Active voice
- No hedging language

## Content Types Needed
1. LinkedIn Post (short)
2. LinkedIn Article (long form)
3. X.com post
4. YouTube video transcript

Now I need to clarify a few things with the user before I can plan effectively:
1. What is the live URL of the portfolio?
2. Should I focus on the "Universal CV Engine" as the main story, or the career transition, or both?
3. What's the hook for next post - is there a follow-up topic in mind?
4. For YouTube - what format? Talking head, screen recording, or generated video?
5. Any specific metrics or numbers they want to highlight?

Let me ask these questions.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

I now have a comprehensive understanding of your portfolio project. Here's what I found:

## Project Summary
**Edge of Trust** - A Universal CV Engine with AI-powered variant generation, quality pipeline (eval + red team), 9 active variants, 69 markdown files across documentation, case studies, and blog posts.

## Top 3 Learnings Identified
1. **Distribution Beats Product** - Partnership with Archway protocol > 100 marketing campaigns
2. **Customer ≠ User** - Shifting from developers to protocols → 15× revenue
3. **Trust Is Your Moat** - Institutions buy auditability, not performance

## Writing Style
Direct, prose-based (no bullets in conversational content), active voice, warm but professional.

2. **Next hook**: Job update - open to roles, invite conversations
3. **YouTube format**: Just the transcript (they'll decide format later)
4. **URL**: edgeoftrust.com

Now I can design the content plan. Let me write the plan file with:
- LinkedIn Post (short, punchy)
- LinkedIn Article (long-form, detailed)
- X.com post (thread or single?)
- YouTube transcript

The plan should include:
- Structure for each piece
- Key talking points
- The "hook" for job update/engagement
- References to Dmitrii's writing style

Let me write this plan.

     6→thumbnail: null
     7→---
     8→
     9→Found myself between roles. Sat with the question everyone asks: *what's next?*
    10→
    11→I knew two things: I wanted to stay at the intersection of Web3 and AI, and I needed a better way to present my work. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. LinkedIn felt like shouting into the void.
    12→
    13→So I started building. Three months later, I had something unexpected: not just a portfolio, but a system that proves its own claims.
    14→
    15→## The Problem
    16→
    17→Generic portfolios don't convert. Every product manager has "drove growth" and "led cross-functional teams" on their resume. Metrics help, but metrics without sources feel hollow. How do you know those numbers are real?
    18→
    19→And here's the real problem: when you're applying for multiple roles, you need different emphasis. The infrastructure PM variant isn't the Web3 PM variant isn't the developer tools PM variant. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare.
    20→
    21→I wanted something that could generate targeted variants while ensuring every claim was defensible.
    22→
    23→## What I Built
    24→
    25→The system has four layers:
    26→
    27→**Knowledge Base**: Every achievement lives in structured YAML, using STAR format (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Each metric traces to a source. No hallucination possible—the AI can only surface what's already documented.
    28→
    29→**Variant Engine**: Takes a job description, matches it against my knowledge base, scores relevance, and generates a customized portfolio. Different stats, different case study ordering, same underlying facts.
    30→
    31→**Quality Pipeline**: This is where it gets interesting. Every variant runs through:
    32→- **Eval**: Extracts claims, finds candidate sources, verifies each metric
    33→- **Red Team**: Scans for sycophantic language, unverified metrics, cross-variant contamination, confidential leaks
    34→
    35→**Skills Ecosystem**: Nine Claude Code skills that codify the workflow. The AI doesn't freelance—it follows documented patterns with human approval gates.
    36→
    37→## The Numbers
    38→
    39→What three months of building produced:
    40→
    41→| Metric | Value |
    42→|--------|-------|
    43→| CSS Variables | 124 (full design system) |
    44→| Initial Bundle | 195KB gzip (59% reduction from 480KB) |
    45→| Claude Code Skills | 9 (knowledge → content → variants) |
    46→| Job-Specific Variants | 9 active |
    47→| Claims Per Variant | ~6 (100% traceable) |
    48→| Red Team Checks | 8 automated gates |
    49→| Tests | 211 passing |
    50→
    51→## What I Learned
    52→
    53→### Tier 1: Fundamental Shifts
    54→
    55→**Schema is law.** Zod validates everything. A typo in a YAML field doesn't silently fail—it blocks the build. Content quality compounds when you enforce it at the source.
    56→
    57→**Voice is brand.** I created a separate skill just for writing style. Not embedded in generators—explicit and mandatory. Same facts rendered in consistent voice across every variant, email, and document.
    58→
    59→**Verification beats trust.** Every metric in a variant traces to a knowledge base file. If the source changes, the variant fails eval. You can't accidentally ship unverified claims.
    60→
    61→### Tier 2: Architectural Decisions
    62→
    63→**YAML for humans, JSON for machines.** Variants live in YAML (human-reviewable), sync to JSON (runtime artifact). One canonical source, derived outputs. No drift.
    64→
    65→**Code splitting saved 59%.** The bundle hit 480KB and I stopped everything to fix it. Lazy-loaded routes, vendor chunking, component-level splitting. Target was under 200KB—hit 195KB.
    66→
    67→**CSS variables over CSS-in-JS.** Theme switching is instant—no React re-render needed. 124 variables covering color, spacing, layout, effects. Dark and light mode parity without JavaScript overhead.
    68→
    69→### Tier 3: Process Insights
    70→
    71→**Pause between phases.** The variant skill has explicit approval gates: show content → user approves → run eval → user reviews → red team → user approves → ship. No autonomous hallucination.

    77→### Tier 4: Meta Learnings
    78→
    79→**ADHD patterns are predictable.** I built a skill that diagnoses drift: tooling rabbit holes, perfect setup syndrome, research loops, scope creep. The system catches me when I'm avoiding the real work.

    85→## The Pipeline in Practice
    86→
    87→Here's what generating a variant actually looks like:
    88→
    89→```bash
    90→# Phase 1: Job analysis
    91→# Extract requirements, generate slug, check for existing variants
    92→
    93→# Phase 2: Knowledge base query
    94→npm run cv-knowledge-query -- --theme "institutional-crypto"
    95→
    96→# Phase 3: Content generation (with writing style skill)
    97→# Generate hero, about, stats—all from verified sources
    98→
    99→# Phase 4: Sync and validate
   100→npm run variants:sync -- --slug microsoft-senior-pm
   101→
   102→# Phase 5: Evaluate claims
   103→npm run eval:variant -- --slug microsoft-senior-pm
   104→# Output: 6/6 claims verified
   105→
   106→# Phase 6: Red team
   107→npm run redteam:variant -- --slug microsoft-senior-pm
   108→# Output: 0 FAIL, 0 WARN
   109→
   110→# Phase 7: Visual review
   111→open "http://localhost:5173/microsoft/senior-pm"
   112→```
   113→
   114→The whole flow takes about 15 minutes. Most of that is human review, not generation.
   115→
   116→## Why This Matters
   117→
   118→Most AI-generated content has a trust problem. It sounds plausible but might be fabricated. For a portfolio—where your professional reputation is on the line—that's unacceptable.
   119→
   120→This system inverts the approach:
   121→1. Start with verified source data
   122→2. Constrain generation to that data
   123→3. Evaluate every claim against sources
   124→4. Red-team for tone and accuracy issues
   125→5. Require human approval at each gate
   126→
   127→The AI assists with targeting and presentation. The facts come from documented achievements.
   128→
   129→## What's Next
   130→
   131→The portfolio is live. The capstone is submitted. But the work continues:
   132→
   133→- **More variants**: Galaxy, Microsoft, Coinbase, Gensyn all in active rotation
   134→- **Case studies**: Documenting the portfolio build itself, the Universal CV pipeline, the AI-assisted job search
   135→- **Open source**: Planning to release the variant generation system once it's battle-tested
   136→
   137→## The Real Lesson
   138→
   139→Career transitions create space. This one let me build something I wouldn't have built otherwise—a portfolio that doesn't just show my work, but demonstrates the rigor I bring to shipping.
   140→
   141→Every claim traceable. Every variant verified. Every stat defensible in an interview.
   142→
   143→That's the portfolio I wanted. That's the portfolio I built.
   144→
   145→---
   146→
   147→*The capstone is complete. If you're building in the AI evaluation space or thinking about similar problems, I'd love to hear from you.*

Found myself between roles a few months ago. Instead of mass-applying, I built something.

The problem: static resumes don't adapt. You need different emphasis for infrastructure PM vs. developer tools PM vs. Web3 PM. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare. And AI-generated content? Sounds good until someone asks where those metrics came from.

So I built a Universal CV Engine. One knowledge base stores every achievement with traceable sources. The system generates targeted variants for each role while ensuring every claim is defensible. Red team checks catch sycophantic language and unverified metrics before anything ships.

Three months later: 9 job-specific variants, 211 passing tests, every stat traceable to source documentation. The portfolio doesn't just show my work—it demonstrates the rigor I bring to shipping.

After years building infrastructure at Microsoft, Ankr, and Anchorage Digital, I'm exploring what's next. If you're building in Web3, AI infrastructure, or institutional crypto—let's talk.

**Title**: I Built a Portfolio That Proves Itself

---

Found myself between roles a few months ago. Sat with the question everyone asks: what's next?

I knew two things. I wanted to stay at the intersection of Web3 and AI. And I needed a better way to present my work. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. LinkedIn felt like shouting into the void.

So I started building. Three months later, I had something unexpected: not just a portfolio, but a system that verifies its own claims.

## The Problem with Portfolios

Every product manager has "drove growth" and "led cross-functional teams" on their resume. Metrics help, but metrics without sources feel hollow. How do you know those numbers are real?

Here's the deeper problem: when you're applying for multiple roles, you need different emphasis. The infrastructure PM pitch isn't the Web3 PM pitch isn't the developer tools PM pitch. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare. You either send generic content or burn hours on customization.

AI-generated content seems like the answer—until someone asks where those metrics came from. Most AI portfolios have a trust problem. They sound plausible but might be fabricated.

I wanted something that could generate targeted variants while ensuring every claim was defensible in an interview.

## What I Built

The system has four layers.

**Knowledge Base**: Every achievement lives in structured YAML using STAR format. Each metric traces to a source document. No hallucination possible—the AI can only surface what's already documented.

**Variant Engine**: Takes a job description, matches it against my knowledge base, scores relevance, and generates a customized portfolio. Different stats, different case study ordering, same underlying facts.

**Quality Pipeline**: Every variant runs through evaluation (extracting claims, finding sources, verifying each metric) and red-teaming (scanning for sycophantic language, unverified metrics, confidential leaks). Nothing ships without passing both gates.

**Skills Ecosystem**: Nine Claude Code skills that codify the workflow. The AI doesn't freelance—it follows documented patterns with human approval at each step.

## Three Learnings Worth Sharing

Building this system crystallized insights from years of shipping infrastructure products.

**Distribution beats product.** At my previous startup, we spent months building the best on-chain alerting product. Competitors with worse products still won. The difference? We eventually launched as the default alerting provider for an entire blockchain ecosystem. One partnership delivered more than a hundred marketing campaigns could. The best product doesn't win—the best-distributed product does.

**Customer isn't always user.** At Ankr, we spent eight months chasing individual developers. Made $130K ARR. Then we shifted focus to blockchain protocols as customers instead of developers. Same product, different buyer. Revenue increased 15x in six months. Sometimes the unit economics problem isn't your product—it's who you're optimizing for.

**Trust is the moat.** In institutional crypto, nobody cares about the best APY. They care about auditability, compliance, and defensibility. At Microsoft, we shipped a blockchain royalty system for 2.7 billion Xbox consumers not because it was the fastest—because it was the most defensible. This portfolio applies the same principle: every claim traces to a source. Every stat survives scrutiny.

## The Numbers

What three months of building produced:

- 124 CSS variables defining a complete design system
- 195KB initial bundle (reduced 59% from 480KB)
- 9 job-specific variants in active rotation
- 211 passing tests across 10 test suites
- 8 automated red-team checks per variant
- 100% claim traceability to source documentation

The whole variant generation flow takes about 15 minutes. Most of that is human review, not generation.

## Why This Approach Matters

Most AI-generated content requires you to trust the output. For a portfolio—where your professional reputation is on the line—that's unacceptable.

This system inverts the approach. Start with verified source data. Constrain generation to that data. Evaluate every claim against sources. Red-team for tone and accuracy issues. Require human approval at each gate.

The AI assists with targeting and presentation. The facts come from documented achievements.

## What's Next

The portfolio is live at edgeoftrust.com. Nine variants covering Bloomberg, Coinbase, Galaxy, Meta, Microsoft, and more—each tailored to the role while maintaining factual consistency.

After years building infrastructure at Microsoft (blockchain royalties for Xbox), Ankr (RPC infrastructure serving millions of requests), and Anchorage Digital (institutional crypto custody), I'm exploring what's next.

If you're building in Web3, AI infrastructure, or institutional crypto, I'd love to connect. Reach out directly or explore the portfolio to see the system in action.

Built a portfolio that generates itself.

One knowledge base. Nine job-specific variants. Zero hallucinations.

Here's how it works: 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**
The problem with AI-generated portfolios: they sound good until someone asks where those metrics came from.

Static resumes don't adapt. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare.

I needed something that could target each role while keeping every claim defensible.

**Tweet 3 (Solution)**
The Universal CV Engine:

→ Knowledge base stores every achievement with traceable sources
→ Variant engine generates targeted content per job description
→ Eval pipeline verifies each claim against source docs
→ Red team catches sycophantic language and unverified stats

---

**Tweet 4 (Innovation)**
The key insight: invert the trust problem.

Most AI content: generate first, hope it's accurate.

This system: verify first, generate under constraint.

The AI can only surface what's already documented. Every stat traces to a source file.

# YouTube Video Transcript

**Title**: I Built a Portfolio That Proves Itself (Universal CV Engine)
**Duration**: ~4 minutes

---

## INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)

I built a portfolio that generates itself. One knowledge base, nine job-specific variants, zero hallucinations.

Found myself between roles a few months ago. The standard resume wasn't cutting it. Maintaining multiple versions by hand was a nightmare. And AI-generated content? Sounds great until someone asks where those metrics came from.

So I built something different. Let me show you how it works.

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:30 - 1:15)

Here's the problem with portfolios in 2025.

Every product manager has "drove growth" and "led cross-functional teams" on their resume. Metrics help, but metrics without sources feel hollow.

When you're applying for multiple roles, you need different emphasis. The infrastructure PM pitch isn't the Web3 PM pitch. The developer tools PM pitch is different again. Customizing for each role takes hours. Most people either send generic content or burn out.

AI-generated content seems like the answer—until you realize most of it hallucinates. It sounds plausible, but the numbers might be made up. For a portfolio where your professional reputation is on the line, that's unacceptable.

I wanted something that could target each role while keeping every claim defensible in an interview.

---

## THE BUILD (1:15 - 2:45)

The Universal CV Engine has four layers.

First, the knowledge base. Every achievement I've ever shipped lives in structured files. Each metric traces to a source document. No hallucination possible—the AI can only surface what's already documented.

Second, the variant engine. Give it a job description, and it matches against my knowledge base, scores relevance, and generates a customized portfolio. Different stats, different case study ordering, same underlying facts.

Third, the quality pipeline. This is where it gets interesting. Every variant runs through an evaluation pass—extracting claims, finding sources, verifying each metric. Then red-teaming—scanning for sycophantic language, unverified stats, confidential leaks. Nothing ships without passing both gates.

Fourth, the skills ecosystem. Nine automation skills that codify the whole workflow. The AI doesn't freelance. It follows documented patterns with human approval at each step.

*[VISUAL: Show edgeoftrust.com with different variant URLs]*

Here's what it looks like in practice. Same portfolio, different variants. Bloomberg Technical PM. Coinbase Product Manager. Galaxy. Meta. Microsoft. Each one tailored to the role, each one traceable to the same source of truth.

---

## TOP 3 LEARNINGS (2:45 - 3:30)

Building this crystallized three insights from years of shipping products.

**One: Distribution beats product.** At my previous startup, we built the best product. Competitors with worse products still won. The difference was distribution. One ecosystem partnership delivered more than a hundred marketing campaigns.

**Two: Customer isn't always user.** At Ankr, we chased developers for eight months. Made $130K ARR. Shifted to protocols as customers instead—same product, different buyer. Revenue increased 15x. Sometimes the unit economics problem isn't your product. It's who you're optimizing for.

**Three: Trust is the moat.** In institutional crypto, nobody cares about the best APY. They care about auditability. This portfolio applies the same principle—every claim traces to a source. Every stat survives scrutiny.

---

## CTA (3:30 - 4:00)

The portfolio is live at edgeoftrust.com. Nine variants, 211 passing tests, 100% claim traceability.

After years building infrastructure at Microsoft, Ankr, and Anchorage Digital, I'm exploring what's next. If you're building in Web3, AI infrastructure, or institutional crypto—link in the description, let's connect.

If you found this useful, subscribe. I'm thinking about open-sourcing the variant generation system. Let me know in the comments if that would be helpful.

Here's the LinkedIn post:

---

Found myself between roles a few months ago. Instead of mass-applying, I built something.

The problem: static resumes don't adapt. You need different emphasis for infrastructure PM vs. developer tools PM vs. Web3 PM. Maintaining multiple versions by hand is a nightmare. And AI-generated content? Sounds good until someone asks where those metrics came from.

So I built a Universal CV Engine. One knowledge base stores every achievement with traceable sources. The system generates targeted variants for each role while ensuring every claim is defensible. Red team checks catch sycophantic language and unverified metrics before anything ships.

Three months later: 9 job-specific variants, 211 passing tests, every stat traceable to source documentation. The portfolio doesn't just show my work—it demonstrates the rigor I bring to shipping.
