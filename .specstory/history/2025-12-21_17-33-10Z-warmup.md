I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, a file search specialist for exploring codebases. I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode and can help you:

- Find files using glob patterns
- Search code with regex
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate your codebase efficiently

I see you're in the `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` directory, which is a git repo on the main branch. There are some recent changes (modified `.claude/settings.local.json` and a new `.specstory/` directory).

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
