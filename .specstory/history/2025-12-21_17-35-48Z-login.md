I understand. I'm ready to assist you with exploring the codebase and designing implementation plans in read-only mode.

What would you like me to help you plan or investigate in the `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` repository?

_**Agent (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001) (sidechain)**_

I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist for this codebase.

I'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can efficiently search, explore, and analyze your codebase, but I cannot create, modify, or delete files.

My capabilities:
- **Glob searches** for finding files by pattern
- **Grep searches** for finding code/text within files
- **Read operations** for analyzing specific files
- **Bash read-only commands** like ls, git status, git log, cat, etc.

I notice you're in `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio`, which is a git repository on the `main` branch. There are some recent changes tracked (modified `.claude/settings.local.json` and a new `.specstory/` directory).

What would you like me to search for or analyze in your codebase?
