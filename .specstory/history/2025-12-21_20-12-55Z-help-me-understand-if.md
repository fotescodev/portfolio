The user is showing me a GitHub Actions workflow runs page. I can see there are two failed builds (marked with red X):

1. "feat: add DF monogram favicon to replace Ethereum logo (#56)" - Deploy #92, commit aa592b7
2. "feat: add interactive UCV-CLI dashboard (npm run ucv-cli)" - Deploy #91, commit 793b365

But importantly, the most recent builds are successful:
1. "Merge pull request #57 from fotescodev/feat/dmitrii-writing-style-..." - Deploy #94, commit 2b2449a (4 minutes ago) - SUCCESS
2. "refactor: consolidate context docs (87% size reduction) (#55)" - Deploy #93, commit 3587099 (10 minutes ago) - SUCCESS

This means the failed builds are from older commits, and subsequent commits have successfully deployed. The current state of main should be fine since the latest deployment succeeded.

Let me check the GitHub Actions to get more details about what happened with those failed builds and confirm the current state.

Looking at the screenshot, I can see two failed builds (red X icons):

1. **#92** - "feat: add DF monogram favicon to replace Ethereum logo (#56)" - commit aa592b7
2. **#91** - "feat: add interactive UCV-CLI dashboard (npm run ucv-cli)" - commit 793b365

**The good news:** These failures are **not affecting your project** because:

- The two most recent builds (#94 and #93) both **succeeded** (green checkmarks)
- Your latest commit `2b2449a` deployed successfully 4 minutes ago
- The failed builds are from older commits that have since been superseded

Let me check what caused those failures to make sure there's no underlying issue:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Now I understand. The failures were due to a dependency conflict between React 18 and React 19. The package.json had react@^18.3.1 but react-dom@^19.2.0, which caused npm ci to fail with ERESOLVE errors.

It seems like this was fixed in a subsequent commit, which is why the later builds succeeded. Let me verify that the current state is good.

Now I can give you a clear answer:

## Summary

**The failed builds are NOT affecting your project.** Here's why:

### What caused the failures
Both failures (#91 and #92) were caused by a **React version mismatch** in package.json:
- `react` was at `^18.3.1`
- `react-dom` was at `^19.2.0`

This caused `npm ci` to fail with `ERESOLVE` dependency conflicts.

### Why it's fine now
The issue was **fixed in a subsequent commit**. Looking at your recent history:
- Deploy #93 (commit 3587099) - **SUCCESS**
- Deploy #94 (commit 2b2449a) - **SUCCESS**

Your latest deployment succeeded, meaning the dependency issue has been resolved and your site is currently deployed correctly.

### No action needed
Since newer commits have already fixed this and deployed successfully, there's nothing you need to do. The failed builds are just historical records of a transient issue that's been resolved.
