I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase! I'm in read-only mode and can efficiently find and analyze files using:

- **Glob** - for pattern matching across files
- **Grep** - for searching file contents with regex
- **Read** - for examining specific files
- **Bash** - for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git commands, etc.)

Your working directory is `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` and it's a git repository on the main branch.

I can see there are recent changes including docs updates, CLI polish, and sprint sync briefings. There's also a modified `.claude/settings.local.json` and a new `.specstory/` directory.

What would you like me to search for or analyze in this codebase?
