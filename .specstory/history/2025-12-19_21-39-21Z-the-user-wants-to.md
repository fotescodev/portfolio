# Manage costs effectively

> Learn how to track and optimize token usage and costs when using Claude Code.

Claude Code consumes tokens for each interaction. The average cost is \$6 per developer per day, with daily costs remaining below \$12 for 90% of users.

For team usage, Claude Code charges by API token consumption. On average, Claude Code costs \~\$100-200/developer per month with Sonnet 4.5 though there is large variance depending on how many instances users are running and whether they're using it in automation.

## Track your costs

### Using the `/cost` command

<Note>
  The `/cost` command is not intended for Claude Max and Pro subscribers.
</Note>

The `/cost` command provides detailed token usage statistics for your current session:

\```
Total cost:            $0.55
Total duration (API):  6m 19.7s
Total duration (wall): 6h 33m 10.2s
Total code changes:    0 lines added, 0 lines removed
\```

### Additional tracking options

Check [historical usage](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console) in the Claude Console (requires Admin or Billing role) and set [workspace spend limits](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces) for the Claude Code workspace (requires Admin role).

<Note>
  When you first authenticate Claude Code with your Claude Console account, a workspace called "Claude Code" is automatically created for you. This workspace provides centralized cost tracking and management for all Claude Code usage in your organization. You cannot create API keys for this workspace - it is exclusively for Claude Code authentication and usage.
</Note>

## Managing costs for teams

When using Claude API, you can limit the total Claude Code workspace spend. To configure, [follow these instructions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9796807-creating-and-managing-workspaces). Admins can view cost and usage reporting by [following these instructions](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9534590-cost-and-usage-reporting-in-console).

On Bedrock and Vertex, Claude Code does not send metrics from your cloud. In order to get cost metrics, several large enterprises reported using [LiteLLM](/en/third-party-integrations#litellm), which is an open-source tool that helps companies [track spend by key](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/virtual_keys#tracking-spend). This project is unaffiliated with Anthropic and we have not audited its security.

### Rate limit recommendations

When setting up Claude Code for teams, consider these Token Per Minute (TPM) and Request Per Minute (RPM) per-user recommendations based on your organization size:

| Team size     | TPM per user | RPM per user |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1-5 users     | 200k-300k    | 5-7          |
| 5-20 users    | 100k-150k    | 2.5-3.5      |
| 20-50 users   | 50k-75k      | 1.25-1.75    |
| 50-100 users  | 25k-35k      | 0.62-0.87    |
| 100-500 users | 15k-20k      | 0.37-0.47    |
| 500+ users    | 10k-15k      | 0.25-0.35    |

For example, if you have 200 users, you might request 20k TPM for each user, or 4 million total TPM (200\*20,000 = 4 million).

The TPM per user decreases as team size grows because we expect fewer users to use Claude Code concurrently in larger organizations. These rate limits apply at the organization level, not per individual user, which means individual users can temporarily consume more than their calculated share when others aren't actively using the service.

<Note>
  If you anticipate scenarios with unusually high concurrent usage (such as live training sessions with large groups), you may need higher TPM allocations per user.
</Note>

## Reduce token usage

* **Compact conversations:**

  * Claude uses auto-compact by default when context exceeds 95% capacity
  * Toggle auto-compact: Run `/config` and navigate to "Auto-compact enabled"
  * Use `/compact` manually when context gets large
  * Add custom instructions: `/compact Focus on code samples and API usage`
  * Customize compaction by adding to CLAUDE.md:

    \```markdown  theme={null}
    # Summary instructions

    When you are using compact, please focus on test output and code changes
    \```

* **Write specific queries:** Avoid vague requests that trigger unnecessary scanning

* **Break down complex tasks:** Split large tasks into focused interactions

* **Clear history between tasks:** Use `/clear` to reset context

Costs can vary significantly based on:

* Size of codebase being analyzed
* Complexity of queries
* Number of files being searched or modified
* Length of conversation history
* Frequency of compacting conversations

## Background token usage

Claude Code uses tokens for some background functionality even when idle:

* **Conversation summarization**: Background jobs that summarize previous conversations for the `claude --resume` feature
* **Command processing**: Some commands like `/cost` may generate requests to check status

These background processes consume a small amount of tokens (typically under \$0.04 per session) even without active interaction.

## Tracking version changes and updates

### Current version information

To check your current Claude Code version and installation details:

\```bash  theme={null}
claude doctor
\```

This command shows your version, installation type, and system information.

### Understanding changes in Claude Code behavior

Claude Code regularly receives updates that may change how features work, including cost reporting:

* **Version tracking**: Use `claude doctor` to see your current version
* **Behavior changes**: Features like `/cost` may display information differently across versions
* **Documentation access**: Claude always has access to the latest documentation, which can help explain current feature behavior

### When cost reporting changes

If you notice changes in how costs are displayed (such as the `/cost` command showing different information):

1. **Verify your version**: Run `claude doctor` to confirm your current version
2. **Consult documentation**: Ask Claude directly about current feature behavior, as it has access to up-to-date documentation
3. **Contact support**: For specific billing questions, contact Anthropic support through your Console account

<Note>
  For team deployments, we recommend starting with a small pilot group to
  establish usage patterns before wider rollout.

<Tip>
  The `--output-format json` flag is particularly useful for scripting and
  automation, allowing you to parse Claude's responses programmatically.
</Tip>

### Agents flag format

The `--agents` flag accepts a JSON object that defines one or more custom subagents. Each subagent requires a unique name (as the key) and a definition object with the following fields:

| Field         | Required | Description                                                                                                            |
| :------------ | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description` | Yes      | Natural language description of when the subagent should be invoked                                                    |
| `prompt`      | Yes      | The system prompt that guides the subagent's behavior                                                                  |
| `tools`       | No       | Array of specific tools the subagent can use (for example, `["Read", "Edit", "Bash"]`). If omitted, inherits all tools |
| `model`       | No       | Model alias to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku`. If omitted, uses the default subagent model                          |

Example:

\```bash  theme={null}
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  },
  "debugger": {
    "description": "Debugging specialist for errors and test failures.",
    "prompt": "You are an expert debugger. Analyze errors, identify root causes, and provide fixes."
  }
}'
\```

For more details on creating and using subagents, see the [subagents documentation](/en/sub-agents).

### System prompt flags

Claude Code provides three flags for customizing the system prompt, each serving a different purpose:

| Flag                     | Behavior                           | Modes               | Use Case                                                             |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--system-prompt`        | **Replaces** entire default prompt | Interactive + Print | Complete control over Claude's behavior and instructions             |
| `--system-prompt-file`   | **Replaces** with file contents    | Print only          | Load prompts from files for reproducibility and version control      |
| `--append-system-prompt` | **Appends** to default prompt      | Interactive + Print | Add specific instructions while keeping default Claude Code behavior |

**When to use each:**

* **`--system-prompt`**: Use when you need complete control over Claude's system prompt. This removes all default Claude Code instructions, giving you a blank slate.
  \```bash  theme={null}
  claude --system-prompt "You are a Python expert who only writes type-annotated code"
  \```

* **`--system-prompt-file`**: Use when you want to load a custom prompt from a file, useful for team consistency or version-controlled prompt templates.
  \```bash  theme={null}
  claude -p --system-prompt-file ./prompts/code-review.txt "Review this PR"
  \```

* **`--append-system-prompt`**: Use when you want to add specific instructions while keeping Claude Code's default capabilities intact. This is the safest option for most use cases.
  \```bash  theme={null}
  claude --append-system-prompt "Always use TypeScript and include JSDoc comments"
  \```

<Note>
  `--system-prompt` and `--system-prompt-file` are mutually exclusive. You cannot use both flags simultaneously.
</Note>

<Tip>
  For most use cases, `--append-system-prompt` is recommended as it preserves Claude Code's built-in capabilities while adding your custom requirements. Use `--system-prompt` or `--system-prompt-file` only when you need complete control over the system prompt.
</Tip>

For detailed information about print mode (`-p`) including output formats,
streaming, verbose logging, and programmatic usage, see the
[SDK documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agent-sdk).

## Summary: Checking Quota/Usage in Claude Code

Based on the official Claude Code documentation, here's what I found about checking quota and usage:

### Main Method: `/cost` Command

The primary way to check your quota and token usage is with the **`/cost` command** in Claude Code. This command provides:
- Total cost for the current session
- Total API duration
- Wall clock duration
- Code changes made (lines added/removed)

Example output:
```
Total cost:            $0.55
Total duration (API):  6m 19.7s
Total duration (wall): 6h 33m 10.2s
Total code changes:    0 lines added, 0 lines removed
```

**Note:** The `/cost` command is not intended for Claude Max and Pro subscribers.

### Historical Usage and Spend Limits

For more comprehensive tracking and quota management, you can:
1. **Check historical usage** in the Claude Console (requires Admin or Billing role)
2. **Set workspace spend limits** for your team (requires Admin role)

When you first authenticate Claude Code with your Claude Console account, a workspace called "Claude Code" is automatically created for managing all Claude Code usage and costs across your organization.

### Cost Information

- **Average cost:** ~$6 per developer per day
- **Daily limit for 90% of users:** Below $12
- **Team usage:** ~$100-200 per developer per month with Sonnet 4.5 (varies with usage patterns)

### Version Checking

To check your current Claude Code version and installation details:
```bash
claude doctor
```
