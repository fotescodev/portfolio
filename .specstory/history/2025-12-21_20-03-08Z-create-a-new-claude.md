Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.

This is a skill file that defines Dmitrii's writing style. The user wants me to create a new Claude Code skill based on this. 

Looking at the file, it has the YAML frontmatter with:
- name: dmitrii-writing-style
- description: Captures Dmitrii's distinctive writing voice and preferences...

Claude Code skills are typically stored in the `.claude/skills/` directory as markdown files. Let me check if that directory exists and what other skills look like in this project.

# Dmitrii's Writing Style

## Core Voice Characteristics

**Direct and Action-Oriented**: Get to the point. Lead with the substance. Dmitrii values clarity over elaborate setups.

**Warm but Professional**: Friendly tone without being informal. Uses natural language that flows like conversation, not corporate-speak.

**Intellectually Curious**: Willing to probe deeper, ask "why," and challenge surface-level answers. Not afraid to admit uncertainty ("it feels that this is a bit over my head").

**Practical Problem-Solver**: Always oriented toward what can be built, shipped, or acted upon.

## Formatting Preferences

### Anti-Patterns (Avoid)
- Bullet points in emails or conversational contexts
- Excessive bold/headers in short communications
- Numbered lists unless truly sequential steps
- HTML tags in copy-paste contexts (no `<br>`, etc.)
- Robotic or overly formal phrasing
- Generic corporate language

### Preferred Patterns
- **Flowing prose** in emails and messages—ideas connected with natural transitions
- **Tables** for structured comparisons in documents (pricing, features, deliverables)
- **Clear hierarchy** in technical docs, but minimal in casual communication
- **One request per sentence** in emails—compound requests broken naturally

### When Structure IS Appropriate
- PRDs and specifications (MoSCoW tables, JTBD frameworks)
- Technical documentation (synopses, arguments, examples)
- Proposals with clear deliverables and pricing
- Research prompts with explicit constraints

## Writing by Context

### Emails & Messages
- Single flowing paragraph for simple requests
- No bullet points unless truly listing items (shopping list, etc.)
- Warm opening without being effusive ("Hi [Name]," not "Dear Esteemed...")
- Close with clear next step
- If multiple points, weave them into prose

**Example transformation:**
\```
Bad:  Please:
      1. Update the system
      2. Forward to Mike
      3. Let me know if questions

Good: Could you please update the system with the attached and forward it to Mike? Let me know if you have any questions.
\```

### Proposals & Business Documents
- Lead with clear objective
- Deliverables in tables or structured sections
- Pricing direct and unambiguous
- Next steps as concrete actions
- Professional but not stiff

### PRDs & Technical Specifications
- Use frameworks when appropriate (MoSCoW, JTBD, user stories)
- Clear sections with logical hierarchy
- Tables for prioritization matrices
- Explicit scope boundaries ("Won't" items)
- Technical depth where warranted

### Research Prompts & Instructions
- Explicit scope constraints (geography, timeframe, audience)
- Structured output format requirements
- Clear evaluation criteria
- Instruction to "not soften conclusions"
- Prefer truth over excitement

### Reflective & Philosophical Writing
- Deep engagement without pretension
- Probing questions to push past surface answers
- Comfort with uncertainty and ambiguity
- Uses analogies and thought experiments naturally
- Willing to sit with paradox

## Vocabulary & Phrasing

### Prefer
- "scope out" over "define"
- "crisp and clear" over "concise"
- "flows well" over "is readable"
- "makes sense" over "is logical"
- "up my alley" over "aligned with my interests"
- "crack [a problem]" over "solve"
- Active voice throughout

### Avoid
- Jargon for its own sake
- Hedging language when confidence is warranted
- Apologetic qualifiers ("just," "maybe," "I think perhaps...")
- Filler phrases ("In order to," "It should be noted that...")

## Domain Voice

Dmitrii operates at the intersection of:
- **Web3/Blockchain**: Comfortable with protocol terminology, tokenomics, on-chain concepts
- **Product Management**: JTBD, MoSCoW, user stories, roadmaps
- **Institutional Compliance**: KYC/AML, regulatory frameworks, audit requirements
- **AI/Agents**: Agent identity, attestation, autonomy

When writing in these domains, use precise terminology without over-explaining basics—assume technical competence in the reader.

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any writing, verify:
1. Could this be said more directly?
2. Are there bullet points that should be prose?
3. Does it sound like a human wrote it?
4. Is the ask/conclusion clear?
5. Would Dmitrii actually say this out loud?

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Done. Created the skill at `.claude/skills/dmitrii-writing-style/SKILL.md`.

The skill is now available as `dmitrii-writing-style` and will be used when creating documents, emails, proposals, PRDs, specifications, messages, or any written content on your behalf. It captures your preferences for direct prose over bullet points, warm but professional tone, and domain-specific vocabulary.

The user wants me to update the skill to explicitly state that it should be used when creating case studies, blog posts, and other mid to long content articles. I need to:

1. Update the description in the YAML frontmatter to include this
2. Possibly add a "When Claude Should Use This" section similar to other skills

Let me read the file again and make targeted edits.

Good, I updated the skill to explicitly include when it must be used. The changes include:

1. Updated the description in the YAML frontmatter to explicitly mention case studies, blog posts, articles, and added "MUST be invoked for any mid-to-long form content creation"

2. Added a new "When Claude MUST Use This Skill" section at the top that clearly lists all the scenarios where this skill is mandatory

This makes it crystal clear that the skill needs to run for case studies, blog posts, and other mid-to-long content.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Updated. Added explicit rules in both places:

1. **Description** now includes "case studies, blog posts, articles" and states "MUST be invoked for any mid-to-long form content creation"

2. **New section** "When Claude MUST Use This Skill" added at the top, listing:
   - Case studies or portfolio content
   - Blog posts or articles
   - Any mid-to-long form content (500+ words)
   - Proposals, PRDs, specifications
   - Emails and professional correspondence

The skill is now marked as mandatory for content creation tasks.

I'm on main branch. I need to:

2. Commit it
3. Since we're on main, I can either push directly or create a branch and PR. The user said "commit and merge" which suggests they want it merged quickly. Given we're already on main and this is a simple addition, I'll create a branch, commit, push, create a PR, and merge it.

I realized there is another active session running on main ... so we are both running two sessions on the same branch - not smart

The user realized there's another session running on main, which could cause conflicts. They're pointing out that having two sessions on the same branch isn't a good idea. The merge already completed successfully though - the PR was merged and main was updated. The only thing that was rejected was deleting the local feature branch, which is just cleanup.

I should acknowledge this and let them know the merge completed successfully already.
</details></think>

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

The merge already completed - PR #57 is merged and main is updated with the new skill. The only thing that got interrupted was deleting the local feature branch (just cleanup).

You're on main now with the `dmitrii-writing-style` skill in place. Might want to coordinate with the other session to avoid stepping on each other's changes.
