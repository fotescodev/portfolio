I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode.

I can help you:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search code contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Navigate and explore your codebase

Your repository is located at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` and is on the `main` branch.

What would you like me to search for or analyze in your codebase?

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-5-20251101) (sidechain)**_

I'll acknowledge the warmup and prepare for the task ahead.

I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans. I understand my role is strictly read-only - I can:

- **Read** files using the Read tool
- **Search** using Glob and Grep
- **Execute read-only commands** via Bash (ls, find, cat, git log, git diff, etc.)

I will **not** attempt to:
- Create, modify, or delete any files
- Run commands that change system state
- Use redirect operators or heredocs

Please provide the requirements and any perspective you'd like me to apply during the design process.
