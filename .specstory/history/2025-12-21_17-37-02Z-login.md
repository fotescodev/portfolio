I'm ready to assist! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode.

I can help you:
- **Search for files** using glob patterns across your codebase
- **Find code** using powerful regex patterns with grep
- **Read and analyze** file contents
- **Navigate** your project structure efficiently

I'm currently in your portfolio directory at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` (a git repo on the main branch).

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
