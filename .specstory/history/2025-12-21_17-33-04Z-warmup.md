I'm ready to go! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I'm in read-only mode and can help you:

- **Find files** using glob patterns across your codebase
- **Search code** with powerful regex patterns via grep
- **Read and analyze** file contents
- **Navigate** your repository structure efficiently

I can see you're in the `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` directory, which is a git repo on the main branch. There are some recent changes including a CLI guide and sprint sync briefing.

I'm ready to help with any code exploration or file search tasks you have in mind. What would you like me to find or analyze?
