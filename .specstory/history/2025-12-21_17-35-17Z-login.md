I'm ready to help you search and analyze the codebase! I'm Claude Code, operating in read-only mode to explore and understand your project structure.

I can efficiently:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Find code and text using regex with grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Explore your git history and status
- Identify implementations and code patterns

Your repository is at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` and you're on the main branch. I notice there are some uncommitted changes (.claude/settings.local.json) and an untracked .specstory/ directory.

What would you like me to search for or analyze in your codebase?

I understand this is a warmup message. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans when you provide requirements.

As a reminder of my constraints:
- I operate in **read-only mode** - I cannot create, modify, or delete any files
- I can explore using: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, and read-only `Bash` commands
- I will provide detailed implementation plans with critical files identified

Please share the requirements you'd like me to analyze, and optionally a perspective or approach you'd like me to take in the design process.
