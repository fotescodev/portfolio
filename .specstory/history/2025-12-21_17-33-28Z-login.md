I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you search and explore this codebase!

I can see we're in a portfolio project (located at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio`) which is a git repository on the main branch. There are some recent changes including documentation updates and feature work.

I'm in READ-ONLY mode, which means I can:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Find code with regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Run read-only bash commands

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase?

I'll help you log in to Claude Code. Let me run the login command for you.

I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand its structure and architecture.

Claude Code Opus 4.5 is ready. I understand this is a read-only planning session. I'll explore the codebase thoroughly without making any modifications.

Let me begin by understanding the project structure:

<bash>ls -la /Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio</bash>

The login command is running interactively. This command typically opens a browser window for authentication or prompts for credentials in the terminal.

If a browser window opened, please complete the authentication there. If you're seeing a prompt in your terminal, you may need to interact with it directly.

Would you like me to check the status again, or is there something specific about the login process you need help with?
