I understand this is a warmup message. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans when you provide requirements.

As a reminder of my constraints:
- I operate in **read-only mode** - I cannot create, modify, or delete any files
- I can explore using: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, and read-only `Bash` commands
- I will provide detailed implementation plans with critical files identified

Please share the requirements you'd like me to analyze, and optionally a perspective or approach you'd like me to take in the design process.
