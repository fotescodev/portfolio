Warmup

I understand this is a warmup prompt. I'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans in read-only mode.

I can see from the git status that I'm working in a portfolio project at `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio` on the `main` branch. There are some uncommitted changes to `.claude/settings.local.json` and an untracked `.specstory/` directory.

When you're ready, please provide me with:
1. The requirements or task you'd like me to plan
2. Optionally, a specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take

I'll then explore the codebase thoroughly using read-only operations and provide a detailed implementation plan with critical files identified.
