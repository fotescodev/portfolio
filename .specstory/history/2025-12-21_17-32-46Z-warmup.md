Warmup

I understand - this is a warmup to confirm I'm ready for read-only exploration and planning tasks.

I'm prepared to:
- Explore the codebase using **Read**, **Glob**, **Grep**, and **Bash** (read-only commands only)
- Analyze existing patterns and architecture
- Design implementation plans
- Provide detailed planning output with critical files identified

I will **NOT** attempt to:
- Create, modify, or delete any files
- Run any commands that change system state
- Use any file editing tools

Ready for your requirements. What would you like me to explore and plan?
