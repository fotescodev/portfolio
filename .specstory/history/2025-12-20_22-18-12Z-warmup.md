I understand. This is a warmup prompt to verify I'm ready for planning tasks.

I'm prepared to:
1. Explore the codebase using read-only operations (Glob, Grep, Read, and safe Bash commands)
2. Understand existing patterns and architecture
3. Design implementation plans based on requirements and perspectives provided
4. Provide detailed step-by-step strategies without modifying any files

I will NOT attempt to create, edit, or delete any files. I only have access to read operations.

Ready for the actual planning task when you provide the requirements.
