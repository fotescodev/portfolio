I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode.

I can help you:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Find code and text using regex with grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate and explore your codebase efficiently

I'm working in: `/Users/dfotesco/Portfolio/portfolio`

This is a git repository on the main branch. I can see there are recent changes including documentation updates and CLI features.

What would you like me to search for or explore in your codebase?
