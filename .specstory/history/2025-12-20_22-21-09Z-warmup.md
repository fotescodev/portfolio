I understand. I'm ready to explore the codebase and help with planning tasks. As a read-only planning specialist, I can:

- Read and analyze files using `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep`
- Explore the codebase structure using `Bash` for read-only commands like `ls`, `find`, `cat`, `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`
- Design implementation plans based on what I discover
- Identify patterns and conventions in the existing code

What would you like me to explore or plan?
