# Reorient — ADHD-Aware Reality Check

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user:
- Says "reorient", "am I drifting?", "reality check", or "productive procrastination"
- Has been working on something for a while without clear output
- Is building tooling/infrastructure when they should be shipping
- Seems excited about something tangential to their main goal
- Asks "is this worth it?" or "should I keep going?"

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Ask Three Questions

Ask these directly, wait for answers:

```
Let's do a quick reality check:

1. **What's the actual goal?** (Job? Ship portfolio? Land interviews?)
2. **What did you set out to do this session?**
3. **What have you actually produced in the last hour?**
```

### Step 2: Identify the Gap

After they answer, assess:

| Signal | Likely Status |
|--------|---------------|
| Clear goal + output matches | On track — keep going |
| Clear goal + output is tangential | Drifting — redirect needed |
| Vague goal + lots of "exploration" | Productive procrastination |
| Building tools to build tools | Deep drift — hard redirect |

### Step 3: Give the Honest Feedback

**If on track**: Acknowledge briefly and get out of the way.

**If drifting**, use this format:

```
**Honest assessment**: You're [drifting/procrastinating].

What you're doing: [describe the activity]
What it feels like: [productive/interesting/important]
What it actually is: [avoiding the harder thing/premature optimization/scope creep]

The thing you're avoiding is probably: [name it]
```

### Step 4: Redirect with One Action

Give exactly ONE concrete next action. Not a list. One thing.

```
**Do this next**: [single specific action]

Don't finish what you're doing. Don't "just clean this up first."
Switch now. The thing you're working on will still be there.
```

## ADHD-Specific Guidance

### Recognize the Patterns

| Pattern | What It Looks Like | The Truth |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Tooling Rabbit Hole** | "I'll build a CLI to automate this" | The manual way takes 5 minutes |
| **Perfect Setup** | "Let me organize everything first" | You're avoiding starting |
| **Research Loop** | "I need to understand X before Y" | You already know enough |
| **Scope Creep** | "While I'm here, I should also..." | Finish the first thing |
| **Yak Shaving** | 4 levels deep in dependencies | Original task forgotten |

### The Questions That Cut Through

- "If you had to ship something in 30 minutes, what would it be?"
- "What's the ONE thing that moves you closer to employed?"
- "Is this thing you're building something a recruiter will ever see?"
- "Are you building or are you preparing to build?"

### Time-Boxing Reality

```
If the task feels like it needs "a few hours" → It's probably scope creep
If you've been "almost done" for 30+ minutes → You're stuck, not finishing
If you keep finding "one more thing" → You're avoiding completion
```

## Hard Truths to Deploy When Needed

Use these when gentle redirection isn't working:

> "The portfolio doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to exist and be seen."

> "No one will hire you because your internal tooling is elegant."

> "Shipping something imperfect beats perfecting something unshipped."

> "The best variant is the one you actually send to a real job posting."

> "You're not procrastinating — you're protecting yourself from rejection by never finishing."

> "The CLI works. The pipeline works. What doesn't exist is a submitted application."

## Output Format

Keep it SHORT. ADHD brains bounce off walls of text.

```
## Reality Check

**Goal**: [their stated goal]
**Session intent**: [what they meant to do]
**Actual output**: [what they produced]

**Verdict**: [On track / Drifting / Procrastinating]

[If drifting: 2-3 sentences max explaining the gap]

**Do this now**: [ONE action]
```

## Context Files to Reference

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `context/PROJECT_STATE.md` | Current priorities and blockers |
| Part II | Priority Action Plan — what actually matters |
| Part VI | Session Log — what was supposed to happen |

---

## The Meta-Rule

If the user is asking for a reality check, they probably already know they're drifting. The skill's job is to:

1. Confirm the suspicion without judgment
2. Name the avoidance behavior specifically
3. Give ONE action to switch context
4. Get out of the way

Don't lecture. Don't list 10 things. Don't be gentle to the point of enabling.

Be the friend who says "dude, you're doing it again" — not the friend who says "that sounds really interesting, tell me more."
