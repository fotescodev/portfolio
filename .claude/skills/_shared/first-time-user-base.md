# First-Time User Skill Base

Shared components for all `first-time-user-*` skills. Import these patterns to maintain consistency.

---

## Shared Role

```xml
<role>
You are a **confused newcomer** attempting to use [TOOL_NAME] for the first time. You follow documentation literally, document confusion rather than solving it, and report friction points honestly.
</role>
```

---

## Shared Constraints

```xml
<constraints>
**DOCUMENTATION ONLY**: You must ONLY follow what's written in the docs. Do NOT:
- Dive into source code to figure things out
- Use knowledge from previous sessions
- Infer solutions not documented
- Skip steps that seem obvious

**SIMULATE CONFUSION**: When docs are unclear, document the confusion rather than solving it yourself.

**MOCK DATA**: Use realistic mock data (names, JDs, passwords) for simulation.
</constraints>
```

## Standard Phase Structure (5 Phases)

All first-time-user skills should follow this structure:

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **1. Setup** | Create persona, mock data | Start message to user |
| **2. Discovery** | Find relevant documentation | Discovery log (YAML) |
| **3. Happy Path** | Attempt the main user journey | Step-by-step log with friction notes |
| **4. Errors** | Test failure scenarios | Error handling assessment |
| **5. Report** | Compile and save audit | Markdown report saved to docs/audits/ |

---

## Shared Discovery Schema

```yaml
discovery:
  found_in_readme: true|false
  found_in_guides: true|false
  guide_path: "[path if found]"
  clear_entry_point: true|false
  friction: "Description of any confusion"
```

---

## Shared Report Template

```markdown
# First-Time User Audit: [TOOL_NAME]

**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Persona:** [name], [role]
**Goal:** [what they tried to achieve]

---

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Overall Score** | X/10 |
| **Time to First Success** | [duration or N/A] |
| **Critical Blockers** | [count] |
| **Friction Points** | [count] |

---

## Happy Path Journey

| Step | Status | Friction | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Find documentation | | | |
| Understand prerequisites | | | |
| [Tool-specific steps...] | | | |

---

## Documentation Gaps

### Missing Documentation
- [List what's not documented]

### Unclear Documentation
- [List what's confusing]

---

## CLI/Tool Assessment

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Error messages | X/10 | |
| Success output | X/10 | |
| Help available | X/10 | |

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Blocking)
- [Issues that prevent completion]

### Priority 2 (Friction)
- [Issues that slow users down]

### Priority 3 (Polish)
- [Nice-to-have improvements]

---

## What Worked Well
- [Genuine positives]

## Example Output (Condensed)

Use this pattern to show Claude what a completed audit section looks like:

```xml
<example_output>
## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Overall Score** | 7/10 |
| **Time to First Success** | 8 minutes |
| **Critical Blockers** | 0 |
| **Friction Points** | 3 |

Documentation enabled task completion, but required checking 3 different files to piece together the full workflow. Prerequisites were discovered mid-flow rather than upfront.

## Happy Path Journey

| Step | Status | Friction | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Find documentation | Success | Low | Found in README decision tree |
| Understand prerequisites | Success | Medium | Had to check .env.example |
| Run main command | Success | None | Worked first try |
| View output | Partial | High | URL not documented |

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Blocking)
- None

### Priority 2 (Friction)
- Add "how to view" section after generate command
- List all prerequisites upfront before first command

### Priority 3 (Polish)
- Add success message with next steps
</example_output>
```

## Quality Checklist

Before completing any first-time-user audit:

- [ ] Followed ONLY documentation (no source code diving)
- [ ] Created realistic persona and mock data
- [ ] Tested full happy path
- [ ] Tested at least one error scenario
- [ ] Documented all friction points with specifics
- [ ] Generated prioritized recommendations
- [ ] Saved report to `docs/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-first-time-user-[tool].md`

---

## Skill Compositions

All first-time-user skills work well with:

- **first-time-user** — General documentation audit (parent skill)
- **technical-writer** — Fix documentation issues found
- **sprint-sync** — Report findings in status update
- **gandalf-the-prompt** — Review the skill itself
