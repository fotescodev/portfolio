# Case Study Drawer: Maximum Impact

Going beyond structure—designing for **scanning, emotion, and action**.

---

## Core Principle: "3-Second Payoff"

A hiring manager should understand your value in 3 seconds:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Building Quest Infrastructure for Galxe       │ ← WHAT
│                                                 │
│  $50M+ TVL secured                              │ ← SO WHAT (impact)
│                                                 │
│  Galxe · 2024 · PM Lead                         │ ← WHO/WHEN
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Everything else is just **proof**.

## Visual Hierarchy Improvements

### 1. Bigger Numbers

Current metrics: `40px` serif  
**Proposed**: `56px` or even `72px` for primary metric

Numbers are the universal language of impact. Make them impossible to miss.

### 2. More Whitespace

Current section margins: `56px`  
**Proposed**: `var(--space-5xl)` (96px) between major sections

White space = premium. It signals "I'm confident, I don't need to cram."

### 3. One Accent Color Per Section

Current: Gold + Green + Red visible simultaneously  
**Proposed**: Gold for highlights only. Remove success/danger colors from drawer.

Too many colors = noise.

## Simplified Narrative Flow

Instead of dense paragraphs, use **scannable patterns**:

### Problem Section
```
[LABEL: The Challenge]

"Single-line stakes statement that creates urgency."

Brief context (2-3 sentences max).
```

### Discovery Section
```
[LABEL: Key Insight]

One sentence that shows you understood the root cause.

[→ Decision: What you chose and why, in one line]
```

### Solution Section  
```
[LABEL: What We Built]

Outcome-focused execution phases as a simple list:
• Phase 1: Action → Result
• Phase 2: Action → Result
```

### Outcome Section
```
[BIG NUMBER: $50M+]
[BIG NUMBER: 2x faster]

Qualitative quote (optional)
```

### Lessons Section
```
[LABEL: What I Learned]

Single serif italic quote — no bullet lists.
```

## Remove Friction

| Remove | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Tech stack | No one hires PMs for their tech stack |
| Constraints list | Baked into the story, not a separate section |
| Multiple CTAs | One "Let's talk" button is enough |
| Evidence links | Move to footer text link, not prominent |

---

## The "Magazine Spread" Test

Each section should feel like a magazine page:
- **One focal point** (headline or number)
- **Generous margins**
- **Max 3 text elements** visible at once

If you have to scroll within a section to find the point, it's too long.

## Next Steps

1. Approve direction
2. I'll create a mockup of CaseStudyHero with promoted metric
3. Restructure Narrative into Problem/Insight/Solution
4. Test with your case study content
