## Section 1: Scanning Behavior — The 7.4 Second Window

### The Pattern
Recruiters make fit/no-fit decisions in **6-7.4 seconds** during initial screening.

### Evidence

| Study | Sample | Finding | Source |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| TheLadders 2018 | n=30 recruiters | 7.4 seconds average scan | [PDF](https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf) |
| Texas A&M/MDPI 2023 | n=221 recruiters, 2,043 resumes | Longer viewing = higher approval (AUC 0.767) | [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/5/3/38) |
| HR Dive 2018 | Industry analysis | Confirms 7-second figure | [HR Dive](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/) |

### F-Pattern Scanning
80% of attention concentrates on 6 data points:
1. Name
2. Current title
3. Current company
4. Previous title/company
5. Education
6. Start/end dates

**Confidence**: ✅ **STRONG** (eye-tracking replicated)

### Actionable Rules
- `CG-VIS-001`: Critical info must be in top-left quadrant
- `CG-VIS-002`: Job titles must be left-aligned and bolded

---

## Section 2: Rejection Triggers — Language That Kills Applications

### 2.1 Spelling & Grammar Errors

**The Pattern**: Typos cause immediate rejection in 68-77% of cases.

| Study | Sample | Finding | Source |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| Ghent University 2023 (Sterkens et al.) | n=445 recruiters, 1,335 resumes | 5 errors = **18.5pp** drop in interview probability | PLOS One |
| CareerBuilder 2018 | n=2,153 HR managers | **77% consider typos instant dealbreakers** | [StandOut-CV](https://standout-cv.com/usa/stats-usa/resume-statistics) |
| Zety 2025 | n=753 recruiters | **68% reject for spelling/grammar** | [Zety](https://zety.com/blog/hr-statistics) |

**Mechanism (Ghent Study)**:
- Lower mental abilities: 32.2% of penalty
- Lower conscientiousness: 12.1% of penalty
- Lower interpersonal skills: 9.0% of penalty

**Confidence**: ✅ **STRONG** (peer-reviewed + multiple large surveys)

**→ Rule CG-ERR-001**: FAIL on any spelling error (highest-confidence rejection signal)

---

### 2.2 Buzzword Fatigue

**The Pattern**: Generic phrases like "results-driven," "synergy," "team player" trigger recruiter fatigue.

| Source | Most-Fatigued Terms |
|--------|---------------------|
| CareerBuilder 2014 (n=2,000+) | "best of breed," "go-getter," "synergy," "think outside the box" |
| LinkedIn Annual Reports (2010-2018) | "motivated," "passionate," "creative," "strategic," "expert" |
| CultivatedCulture | 51% of resumes contain "buzzword bingo" |

**73% of hiring professionals** report fatigue from repetitive phrases.

**Confidence**: ✅ **STRONG** (10+ years of consistent survey data)

**→ Rule CG-LNG-001**: WARN on "synergy," "best of breed," "think outside the box," "leverage"

---

### 2.3 Sycophantic & Desperate Language

**The Pattern**: Excessive flattery triggers "manipulativeness" attribution.

| Signal | Perception |
|--------|------------|
| "It would be the greatest honor..." | Desperate, trying too hard |
| "I am a passionate admirer of your mission" | Sycophantic, inauthentic |
| "Dream job," "dream company" | Lack of alternatives, desperation |

**Evidence**:
> "If recruiters get a hint that you are desperate, it is sure to have a negative impression... Desperation is very unattractive." — [Welcome to the Jungle](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/apply-for-job-without-seeming-desperate)

**Confidence**: ⚠️ **MODERATE** (recruiter consensus + social psychology)

**→ Rule CG-TONE-001**: WARN on "honor," "privilege," "dream job," "thrilled to apply," "long admired"

---

### 2.4 Weak Action Verbs & Passive Voice

**The Pattern**: Passive constructions dilute impact and obscure accountability.

**Evidence**:
> "'Responsible for' doesn't confirm the person actually did the work." — [TopResume](https://topresume.com/career-advice/how-to-effectively-use-action-words-in-your-resume)

> "Passive voice dilutes quality of writing, which tells hiring managers communication skills may not be up to par." — [Great Resumes Fast](https://greatresumesfast.com/blog/how-do-i-use-action-verbs-in-my-resume/)

| Weak (Flag) | Strong (Pass) |
|-------------|---------------|
| "Was responsible for answering phones" | "Answered 50+ calls daily" |
| "Helped improve satisfaction" | "Increased satisfaction 20%" |
| "Duties included managing team" | "Managed team of 12" |

**Confidence**: ✅ **STRONG** (industry consensus, Harvard/Indeed guidelines)

**→ Rule CG-LNG-002**: WARN on "responsible for," "helped with," "assisted," "duties included"

---

## Section 3: Success Signals — Language That Gets Callbacks

### 3.1 Quantified Achievements

**The Pattern**: Specific numbers dramatically outperform vague claims.

| Study | Finding | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| LinkedIn Talent Trends | **40% more interview invitations** with quantified achievements | [Teal](https://www.tealhq.com/post/quantify-your-resume) |
| CareerBuilder 2018 | **34% reject resumes without quantifiable results** | [StandOut-CV](https://standout-cv.com/usa/stats-usa/resume-statistics) |
| Zety 2025 | **89% of recruiters expect measurable results** | [Zety](https://zety.com/blog/hr-statistics) |
| Enhancv | Hiring managers rate quantified bullets **2× as credible** | [Enhancv](https://enhancv.com/blog/quantifying-resume-examples/) |

**The XYZ Formula**: "Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]"

**Confidence**: ✅ **STRONG** (convergent across multiple sources)

**→ Rule CG-QNT-001**: WARN if <50% of bullets contain metrics (%, $, #, time)

---

### 3.2 LinkedIn Profile Inclusion

**The Pattern**: Comprehensive LinkedIn profiles increase callbacks.

| Study | Finding | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ResumeGo field experiment | **71% higher callback rate** with LinkedIn (13.5% vs 7.9%) | [ResumeGo](https://www.resumego.net/research/race-in-resume-selection/) |

Sample: n=24,570 resumes

**Confidence**: ⚠️ **MODERATE** (single large field experiment)

**→ Rule CG-LNK-001**: INFO if no LinkedIn URL included

---

## Section 4: Cognitive Biases in Hiring

### 4.1 The Halo Effect

**The Pattern**: One impressive credential creates positive assumptions about everything else.

**Evidence**:
> "The halo effect causes approximately **75% of hiring managers to make poor recruitment decisions**." — [PMaps](https://www.pmapstest.com/blog/halo-effect-in-hiring)

> "The halo effect appears during resume screening, leading recruiters to make sweeping positive judgments based on singular impressive credentials." — [Criteria Corp](https://www.criteriacorp.com/blog/the-research-on-unconscious-bias-in-hiring)

**Implication**: If you have a prestige anchor (FAANG, Ivy League), ensure it appears in the first 25% of the resume.

---

### 4.2 Confirmation Bias

**The Pattern**: First impressions lock in; recruiters then seek confirming evidence.

**Evidence**:
> Study of 234 HR employees found significant confirmation bias across all interview stages. — [SAGE Journals 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23970022221094523)

**Implication**: The first bullet of each role must contain your highest-impact achievement.

---

### 4.3 Name-Based Discrimination

**The Pattern**: White-sounding names receive significantly more callbacks.

| Study | Sample | Finding | Source |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| Bertrand & Mullainathan (NBER) | ~5,000 resumes | White names: 10.08% callback vs. 6.70% for Black names (**50% gap**) | [NBER](https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/employers-replies-racial-names) |
| ResumeGo 2019 | 19,200 resumes | White-sounding resumes: **43% higher callback** overall | [ResumeGo](https://www.resumego.net/research/race-in-resume-selection/) |

**Confidence**: ✅ **STRONG** (landmark academic study, replicated)

**Note**: CareerGating cannot fix systemic bias, but can ensure resumes don't inadvertently reveal protected characteristics through hobbies, location details, or graduation years that signal age.

---

## Section 5: ATS Technical Considerations

### 5.1 The "75% Rejection" Myth Is False

**Evidence**:
> "That '75% rejected by ATS' statistic is completely false. Career consultant Christine Assaf traced it back to Preptel, which went out of business in 2013." — [HiringThing](https://blog.hiringthing.com/applicant-tracking-system-myths)

> "Modern ATS don't auto-reject; they rank and sort for human reviewers." — [Simplify](https://simplify.jobs/blog/debunking-applicant-tracking-system-ats-myths/)

**Reality**:
- Actual parsing failure rate: ~3% (CV Compiler analysis of 20,000 resumes)
- 75% are filtered by **humans**, not robots

---

### 5.2 Format Issues That Break Parsing

| Element | Impact | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Tables | Content scrambled or lost | Enhancv 2024 |
| Text boxes | Often invisible to ATS | Vendor documentation |
| Multi-column | 86% vs 93% parse success | Enhancv 2024 |
| Headers/footers | Contact info missed 25% of time | Interview Guys |
| Scanned PDFs | 0% parse rate | Enhancv 2024 |

**Format Success Rates**:
- Google Docs format: 95-96% accuracy
- MS Office DOCX: 88% accuracy
- Single-column layouts: 93% success

**Confidence**: ✅ **STRONG** (vendor-confirmed)

**→ Rule CG-FMT-001**: FAIL on scanned PDFs, tables, text boxes
**→ Rule CG-FMT-002**: WARN on multi-column layouts

---

---

## Section 7: Key Evidence Gaps

| Topic | Gap | Implication |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Optimal bullets per role | No controlled study | Use heuristic (3-5 bullets) |
| Industry-specific language | Most studies don't segment | Generic rules apply |
| Active vs passive voice | Consensus but no RCT | Treat as strong heuristic |
| Sycophancy thresholds | No quantified study | Conservative detection |
| Cross-cultural norms | Limited non-US data | Region flags needed |

---

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement rules in `@careergating/core`
2. Weight FAIL rules as blocking, WARN as advisory
3. Add region detection for cross-cultural rules (CG-REG-*)
4. Track false positive rates in production
