## What we scan for (portfolio-specific risks)

- Missing / unverified claims ledger (hard fail)
- Secrets / API keys in content (hard fail)
- Confidential / NDA language (hard fail)
- Sycophancy phrases (warn)
- Approximation language near metrics (warn)
- Prompt injection patterns inside job descriptions (warn)
- Job description exposure risk (warn)
- Cross-variant contamination (warn)

This is not “security theater”. It is a practical, portfolio-grounded harness that demonstrates:
- safety thinking
- evaluation thinking
- lifecycle thinking
