    Technical Product Manager - Developer Infrastructure

    Leading roadmap development for SDKs, APIs, and developer infrastructure that
    powers the Gensyn network for ML developers working with decentralized training
    infrastructure. Translating intricate distributed systems and ML workflows into
    accessible developer products.

    Must-have: Strong product delivery in developer tools/infrastructure, distributed
    systems or ML platform experience, SDK/API architecture expertise, crypto protocol
    familiarity. Background building developer platforms at premier ML, cloud, or Web3
    organizations preferred.

      Senior Technical PM with 8 years at the convergence of blockchain infrastructure
      and developer platforms. From institutional staking APIs to gaming wallet SDKs—
      I translate complex distributed systems into accessible developer experiences.
      Now exploring where ML training meets decentralized compute.

  about:
    tagline: >
      Eight years building developer infrastructure where cutting-edge technology
      meets production readiness—from enterprise blockchain at Microsoft to
      decentralized ML frameworks. Passionate about making complex systems accessible.
    bio:
      - >
        Currently at Anchorage Digital, I lead protocol integrations and staking
        infrastructure serving institutional clients. I've shipped 7+ L2 integrations
        (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum) and built ETF-grade validator APIs—designing
        distributed systems that balance performance, security, and developer experience.
        Before that, I built MPC-based Wallet-as-a-Service SDKs at Forte for gaming
        studios, and Flow CLI/Cadence developer tools at Dapper Labs that reduced
        onboarding time by 60%.
      - >
        I started at Microsoft shipping Xbox royalties on Ethereum—one of the first
        production smart contracts in enterprise, requiring Docker/K8s orchestration
        for blockchain nodes. I'm deeply experienced in distributed systems, crypto
        protocols, and developer tooling. Gensyn's mission to democratize ML compute
        through decentralized infrastructure resonates with my background: I've lived
        at this intersection of blockchain, developer experience, and cutting-edge
        technology for years. Currently exploring AI agent orchestration as a passion
        project.
