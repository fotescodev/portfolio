headline: "Improved Flow developer onboarding by 60% through CLI and Cadence Playground redesign"

metric:
  value: "60%"
  unit: "reduction in time-to-first-deploy"
  context: "Developer onboarding was key blocker for Flow ecosystem growth"

situation: |
  Dapper Labs needed to grow the Flow blockchain developer ecosystem. Developer
  tools were fragmented—CLI was hard to use, playground was disconnected from
  real development workflow. Time-to-first-deploy was too long, causing developer
  drop-off.

task: |
  Lead developer tooling products (Flow CLI, Cadence Playground) to improve
  onboarding experience and reduce time-to-first-deploy. Work with cross-functional
  team of 8 engineers.

action: |
  Shipped Flow CLI improvements focused on common developer workflows. Redesigned
  Cadence Playground for interactive learning. Created guided onboarding path
  connecting playground to local development. Conducted user research with developers
  at different skill levels to identify pain points.

result: |
  Reduced time-to-first-deploy by 60%. Improved developer retention in first-week
  experience. Created intuition for developer experience that informed future
  tooling decisions.
