headline: "Built Microsoft's first production smart contract—Ethereum royalty system for Xbox eliminating publisher payment disputes"

metric:
  value: "First"
  unit: "smart contract at Microsoft"
  context: "Pioneered enterprise blockchain before 'Web3' existed as a term"

situation: |
  Xbox needed transparent, auditable system for royalty payments to game publishers.
  Existing database systems lacked auditability for complex multi-party calculations.
  Publishers disputed payment accuracy—costing millions in legal fees and damaging
  relationships.

task: |
  Build blockchain-based system providing immutability and transparency publishers
  needed. Automate complex royalty calculations that were error-prone manually.
  Handle Xbox-scale transaction volumes (millions of purchases) with privacy.

action: |
  Chose private Ethereum consortium over public chain—gave publishers independent
  verification without exposing competitive data. Built Docker/Kubernetes architecture
  for consortium nodes. Created key management integrated with Azure Key Vault.
  Developed Solidity contracts for royalty tracking with comprehensive testing framework.
  Ran parallel processing with existing system for validation.

result: |
  Zero disputed payments post-launch—transparent audit trail eliminated disputes.
  System handles Xbox-scale transaction processing. Project became reference
  implementation for Azure blockchain services. Pattern became template for other
  Microsoft blockchain projects. Established internal expertise informing broader
  blockchain strategy.
