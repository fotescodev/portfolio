id: l2-protocol-integrations
headline: "Shipped 7+ L2 protocol integrations with 40% faster cycle time using scalable RICE evaluation framework"

metric:
  value: "7+"
  unit: "protocols shipped"
  context: "Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Plume, Citrea, BOB, Aztec—institutional custody support"

situation: |
  Rapid L2 ecosystem growth meant constant requests to support new chains. Each
  integration required coordination across 4+ internal teams with no standardized
  process. 12+ week average integration time. Leaving revenue on the table while
  competitors moved faster.

task: |
  Create scalable evaluation framework that lets us confidently reject 60% of requests
  while fast-tracking high-value integrations. Turn compliance bottleneck into
  competitive advantage of "institutional rigor."

action: |
  Built RICE-based evaluation framework with parallel workstreams—security, compliance,
  and engineering running simultaneously instead of sequentially. Created RACI matrix
  clarifying ownership. Negotiated SLAs: 2-week assessment, 6-week full integration.
  Trained BD team to self-serve initial RICE scoring. Piloted with Base and Arbitrum
  running in parallel.

result: |
  Reduced per-integration effort by 40% (12+ weeks to ~7 weeks). First time shipping
  3 protocols simultaneously. Framework became company standard. BD team self-serves
  on initial evaluation, reducing PM involvement by 60%. Saved estimated $200K in
  hiring costs while increasing throughput.
