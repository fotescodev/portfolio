headline: "Drove 15× revenue growth ($130K to $2M ARR) by pivoting RPC product from developers to blockchain protocols"

metric:
  value: "15×"
  unit: "revenue growth"
  context: "$130K to $2M ARR in 8 months. Team jobs were on the line without PMF."

situation: |
  Ankr's RPC infrastructure was underutilized and treated as commodity. Competing
  on price with Infura and Alchemy in developer segment was race to the bottom.
  Limited resources (5 engineers), established competitors with strong developer brand.
  Product needed differentiation and sustainable business model or would be shut down.

task: |
  Find product-market fit for RPC infrastructure with limited resources against
  well-funded competitors. Create sustainable revenue model in commoditized market.

action: |
  Pivoted primary customer from developers to protocols—developers became users served
  through protocol partnerships. Interviewed 15+ protocol teams about infrastructure
  pain points. Designed protocol-tier pricing with SLA guarantees. Built Advanced APIs
  (NFT, token, query) as differentiation. Created Ankr.JS SDK. Launched outbound sales
  targeting protocol BD teams.

result: |
  15× revenue growth in 8 months ($130K to $2M ARR). Achieved target that seemed
  impossible at start. 1M+ daily API requests through protocol partnerships.
  Proved B2B model for infrastructure. Ankr raised additional funding citing traction.
  Team avoided layoffs hitting other crypto companies.
