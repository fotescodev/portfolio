# Discover Phase: Problem Validation

---

## Problem Statement

> **Job seekers struggle to tailor applications at scale while maintaining authenticity.**

- Average job seeker applies to 100-200 positions
- Custom tailoring takes 30-60 min per application
- Generic resumes get 2-3% response rates
- Pressure to stand out leads to embellishment

---

## User Research

### Primary User: Job Seeker

**Pain Points:**
1. Rewriting resume for each application is tedious
2. Easy to forget relevant achievements for specific roles
3. No systematic way to match experience to job requirements
4. Risk of inconsistency across application materials

### Secondary User: Recruiter

**What They Value:**
- Role-relevant experience upfront
- Quantified achievements
- Authentic voice (not AI-generated slop)

## Competitive Gap

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Resume builders | Generic output, no personalization per role |
| AI writers | Hallucination risk, no source of truth |
| ATS optimizers | Gaming the system, not genuine fit |
| Portfolio sites | Static, same for every viewer |

**Gap:** No solution offers **dynamic personalization with verifiable accuracy**.

## Key Insights

1. **Authenticity Paradox** — Candidates need to stand out but fear embellishment. AI can personalize while a knowledge base ensures defensibility.

2. **Relevance Over Volume** — The goal isn't to apply more—it's to present the right experience for each role.

3. **Memory is Unreliable** — After 5+ years, candidates forget achievements. A STAR-format knowledge base serves as content system AND interview prep.

4. **Personalized URL Signals Effort** — Sending `edgeoftrust.com/#/stripe/platform-pm` is a differentiator.
