# Edge of Trust — Copy Rewrites

Your current copy is solid—it's concrete and shows real work. These rewrites tighten the prose, cut corporate-speak, and make it sound more like you'd say it out loud.

## Hero Tagline

**Current:**
> Senior Technical PM shipping institutional crypto infrastructure. From Xbox royalties on Ethereum to ETF-grade custody. Now exploring where AI agents meet on-chain execution.

**Rewrite:**
> Senior Technical PM shipping institutional crypto infrastructure. From Xbox royalties on Ethereum to ETF-grade custody. Now building where AI agents meet on-chain execution.

*Rationale: "Now exploring" is hedging. You're not exploring—you're building KYA Protocol. "Now building" is active and true.*

---

## About — Headline

**Current:**
> Eight years shipping products where complexity meets compliance—from enterprise to crypto to whatever comes next.

**Verdict:** Keep as-is. This is crisp, flows well, and sounds like you. The em-dash usage is good. "Whatever comes next" has the right mix of confidence and openness.

## About — Body

**Current:**
> Currently at Anchorage Digital, I lead protocol integrations and staking products for institutional clients—Galaxy, ETF providers, and enterprises navigating crypto custody. Before that, I built Wallet-as-a-Service at Forte, developer tooling at Dapper Labs, and API infrastructure at Ankr.
>
> I started in enterprise blockchain at Microsoft, shipping Xbox royalties on Ethereum before "Web3" was a term. I'm drawn to problems at the intersection of deterministic systems and probabilistic intelligence—where smart contracts meet AI agents.

**Rewrite:**
> At Anchorage Digital, I lead protocol integrations and staking products for institutional clients—Galaxy, ETF providers, and enterprises navigating crypto custody. Before that: Wallet-as-a-Service at Forte, developer tooling at Dapper Labs, API infrastructure at Ankr.
>
> I started in enterprise blockchain at Microsoft, shipping Xbox royalties on Ethereum before "Web3" was a term. The problems I keep returning to sit at the boundary between deterministic systems and probabilistic intelligence—where smart contracts meet AI agents, and neither side fully trusts the other.

*Rationale: Dropped "Currently" (obvious from context). Replaced "I'm drawn to" with something more active. The last clause—"neither side fully trusts the other"—ties to your site name and frames KYA without naming it.*

## Let's Build — CTA

**Current:**
> Open to PM roles in AI, infrastructure, and Web3. Particularly interested in where agents meet on-chain execution. Based in Charlotte, NC (EST), flexible on remote.

**Rewrite:**
> Looking for PM roles in AI, infrastructure, and Web3—especially where agents meet on-chain execution. Charlotte, NC (EST). Remote works.

*Rationale: "Open to" is passive. "Looking for" is direct without being desperate. "Flexible on remote" → "Remote works" is tighter and more conversational.*

## Case Study Blurbs

### 01 — Institutional ETH Staking

**Current:**
> Built ETF-grade staking infrastructure for institutional clients managing billions in AUM

**Rewrite:**
> Shipped ETF-grade staking infrastructure with Liquid Collective—Fidelity and 3iQ as design partners, zero slashing events

*Rationale: "Built" → "Shipped" (your preferred verb). Named the partners—social proof matters. The stat is already in the card; the blurb sets up the story.*

### 02 — On-Chain Alerting Platform

**Current:**
> Co-founded a Web3 SaaS platform delivering sub-second blockchain alerts to 200+ daily active users

**Rewrite:**
> Co-founded Mempools—sub-second on-chain alerts across 5 chains, 200+ DAU. Launched as Archway's default alerting platform on mainnet day.

*Rationale: Named the product. "Web3 SaaS platform delivering" is jargon—just say what it does. The Archway launch is a better proof point than generic DAU.*

### 03 — RPC Infrastructure & APIs

**Current:**
> Repositioned RPC product to target protocols as customers—15× revenue growth in 8 months

**Verdict:** Keep as-is. This is tight—action, strategy, result. The em-dash works. "Repositioned" is the right word here.

### 04 — Royalties on Ethereum

**Current:**
> Built Microsoft's first production blockchain—an Ethereum royalty system serving 2.7B+ gaming consumers

**Rewrite:**
> Microsoft's first production smart contract—an Ethereum royalty system that cut processing from 45 days to 4 minutes for 2.7B+ gaming consumers

*Rationale: "Smart contract" is more precise than "blockchain." Added the 99% faster stat in human terms—45 days to 4 minutes is visceral. Dropped "Built" to vary sentence starts.*

## Role Descriptions — Selected Fixes

Your role bullets use arrows (→) which works for structured content. A few have corporate-speak worth cleaning:

| Current | Rewrite |
|---------|---------|
| Built ERC20 Xpress platform eliminating engineering dependency | Built ERC20 Xpress—instant token custody on any EVM chain, no engineering required |
| Shipped ETH Liquid Staking MVP with Liquid Collective, partnering with Fidelity and 3iQ as design partners | Shipped ETH Liquid Staking MVP with Liquid Collective—Fidelity and 3iQ as design partners |
| Led migration from proprietary attestation to W3C Verifiable Credentials standard, future-proofing platform interoperability | Led migration from proprietary attestation to W3C Verifiable Credentials—opened the door to cross-platform interoperability |
| Developed 'Compliance as a Service' framework automating regulatory adherence | Built 'Compliance as a Service'—automated regulatory adherence for gaming studios integrating Web3 |

*Pattern: "eliminating dependency" → say what it enables. "Future-proofing" → corporate-speak, be specific. "Developed framework" → "Built" is your verb.*

## Summary

Your portfolio copy is already better than most—it's concrete and shows real work. The main adjustments are:

1. Swap passive verbs for active ones
2. Cut jargon that sounds like a press release
3. Add the specific details that make claims credible

The site name "Edge of Trust" is doing a lot of work—the About rewrite leans into it.
